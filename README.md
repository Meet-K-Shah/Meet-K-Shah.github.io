I am an aspiring **Data Scientist** with a strong foundation in Data Science and a belief that **data is the new oil** and I'm here to refine it to make it more insightful, actionable, and valuable. Recently graduated with a Master of Science in Computer and Information Science at the University of Texas at Arlington (GPA: 4.0) 🎓, I’ve honed my skills through internships, experience, research, and hands-on projects. My journey involves **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Data Visualization**, aiming to solve real-world problems and drive impactful, data-driven decisions.
