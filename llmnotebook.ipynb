       "'# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal\\n\\n1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.\\n\\n2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.\\n\\n3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.\\n\\n4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”\\n\\n5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\\n\\n6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.\\n\\n7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”\\n\\n8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.\\n\\n9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. \\n\\nExcerpt from “In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars” by Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the New York Times.

The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.\\n\\n12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.\\n\\n13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2\\n\\n14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\\n\\n15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.\\n\\n16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.\\n\\n17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.\\n\\n18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.\\n\\n19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1\\n\\nExcerpt from “Paris bans driving due to smog” by Robert Duffer, from the Chicago Tribune.

The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.\\n\\n22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.\\n\\n23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .\\n\\n24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.\\n\\n25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.\\n\\n26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .\\n\\n27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.\\n\\n28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\\n\\nExcerpt from “Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota” by Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle Times.

It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .\\n\\n32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.\\n\\n33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”\\n\\n34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.\\n\\n35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.\\n\\n36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .\\n\\n37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.\\n\\n38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.\\n\\n39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.\\n\\n40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”\\n\\n41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .\\n\\n42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.\\n\\n43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”\\n\\nExcerpt from “The End of Car Culture” by Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the New York Times.

       "\"# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register\\n\\n1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\\n\\n2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\\n\\n3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .\\n\\n4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.\\n\\n5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .\\n\\n6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.\\n\\n7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .\\n\\n8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.\\n\\n# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\\n\\n9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college\\n\\n10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.\\n\\n11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?\\n\\n12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.\\n\\n13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .\\n\\n14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!\\n\\n# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner\\n\\n15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.\\n\\n16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.\\n\\n17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.\\n\\n## 1) Certainty of Outcome\\n\\n18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .\\n\\n## 2) Everyone’s President\\n\\n19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.\\n\\n## 3) Swing States\\n\\n20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\\n\\n## 4) Big States\\n\\n21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .\\n\\n## 5) Avoid Run-Off Elections\\n\\n22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .\\n\\n23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .\\n\""

       "'Cars. Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.\\n\\nIn like matter of this, article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\\n\\nLikewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn\\'t that far from you and doesn\\'t need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.'"

       "'The black smoke that leaks out of your car\\'s tailpipe is killing you.\\n\\nWith its toxic chemicals, and the stress that goes along with driving ,it\\'s no wonder why our vehicular casualty rate is so high. The answer seems to be clear,there are many advantages in reducing our car use. Not to mention the money saving opportunities and traffic reduction that come along with letting go of our beloved crutch.\\n\\nThe world has long bin involved in a \"love affair\" with its cars and other forms of motor transportation, and now in 2015 we are by far, paying the price.\\n\\nThe dangers to your personal health and the health of the environment are cringe worthy. France, being one of the most polluted ares in Europe. at one point had 147 micrograms of particulate matter in there air. As a result Pairs put a partial driving ban to clear the air and the results where drastic. In just one week the smog cleared up just enough to lift the ban. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up too 50 percent in some areas in the United states. Transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions. This is cold hard proof that cars are a major contribute to our carbon foot print.\\n\\nMany other countries have taken the lead in ridding the world of this environmental burdon. One of the most major examples being a community in Vauban Germany. The inhabitants of this upscale community have simply given up there cars. The residents agree that the lack of cars have greatly reduced there stress. Similarly, in Bogota Colombia, they have created a set carfree day. This has encouraged other means of travel including biking, walking and skating. It\\'s a fantastic way to lower stress and air pollution all at once. The word is now spreading through Colombia and 2 more cities have joined and municipal authorities from other countries are very excited about the event. It sparked a mass improvement leading too new sidewalks, a reduction in traffic, and more upscale businesses.\\n\\nMore and more people are startting to catch on. The amount of licenses registeres each year are going down drastically and people \"just dont see a need for a vehicle anymore.\" A study last year showed the decress in young people driving is at 23 percent between2001 and 2009. People organize there social life or jobs around where they can take public transportation or a bike. The main point in it all is that a car is just another way to get where your going and most dont really care how they get there in the first place.\\n\\nVehicle ownership is proving to be impractical, harmful, and expensive. With the rise of pedestrian accsess, bikeing, commercial and public transportation the over use of cars is becoming obselete. We need to improve our safety and lower our emissions to keep the planet and ourselves healthy. \"The proof is in the pudding,\" life without cars is on the rise and it is welcomed with both arms open.'"

    "One additional issue to be aware of - since naïve Bayes uses the product of feature probabilities conditioned on each class, we run into a serious problem when new data includes a feature value that never occurs for one or more levels of a response class. What results is P(xi|Ck) = 0 for this individual feature and this zero will ripple through the entire multiplication of all features and will always force the posterior probability to be zero for that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to this problem involves using the Laplace smoother. The Laplace smoother adds a small number to each of the counts in the frequencies for each feature, which ensures that each feature has a nonzero probability of occuring for each class. Typically, a value of one to two for the Laplace smoother is sufficient, but this is a tuning parameter to incorporate and optimize with cross validation."

We don\\'a wana him ao change his mind aboua doing ahis imporaana job for us as a counary.Dear Florida Senator, There has been much controversy over whether or not we should keep the Electoral College or have it removed and vote on the president based on popular vote. I believe the best decision is to change to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. If the system would change, people would feel like their votes actually matter more then they do now. They wouldn\\'t have to worry about the electors flipping sides. Some people though, do say that the way the election is now is completely fair in the case of votes are based on population.\\n\\nTo begin with, if the Electoral College was to be taken out of use, more people would feel like their vote matters. Although you may think you are voting for your choice of president, you are not. As of now, when you cast your vote, you are actually just voting for your candidate\\'s electors, as said in \"What Is the Electoral College\". In the 2000 campaign, voters in seventeen states didn\\'t have a chance to see the candidates at all. Those candidates went mainly to the \"swing\" states, or states that were not certain on who they would be voting for. The states unvisited, such as Rhode Island and South Carolina, were passed over because the candidates knew they would or wouldn\\'t have their vote no matter what. The ones who questioned their vote did not have the chance to see either candidate in their state. In, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\", the rodney and Obama election is mentioned. It brings up the fact that rodney knew that throughout the South, he was going to get their vote. He realized that there was no need to go there because he didn\\'t need anymore popularity in the South because he had already gained their electoral votes. Those who opposed rodney in the southern states felt that their votes would not matter because majority already knew they were voting for rodney. If the system were to change, which I believe it should, more people would feel their votes mattered no matter what state they were in.\\n\\nIn addition to feeling like your vote matters, people never know if the electors would flip their desicions. The slate of electors is not picked by the people. It is said in, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid jdefenses of the system are wrong\", that sometimes the state conventions, the party\\'s central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves choose who will be their electors. That being said, you don\\'t know whether or not the electors will follow your choice of president or not. For example, in 1960, some electors refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and they chose whomever they wanted. If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen. A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now. This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes. You can see that the current system has its flaws.\\n\\nMany people say that it is fair for all states because of their amount of electoral votes. For example, in \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\", Florida, which has a much larger population than Wyoming, recieved 29 electoral votes for Obama while Wyoming only had 3 electoral votes. This, at the same time though, makes candidates want to only go to the larger states to try to get their votes. The smaller states once again feel left out and unappreciated.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote. Above all, it is more fair to the people. Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now. People wouldn\\'t have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for. Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College. I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College. All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree.\"The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens.\" Paragraph 1 The electoral college is made of 538 people called electors, these people are there to take in consideration what the people voted and then they them selves vote physically for the President of the United States. The electoral college is good because there is not as much controversy and if its been fine for this long it would not be changed now.\\n\\ncontroversy, a big word with lots of meaning, but what does it really mean in this context. It is when two or more things are being argued about, in this case two political veiws. Whether or not we should keep the electoral college or get rid of it and go back to popular vote for electing the President of the United States. Having a little bit of controversy is good but the reason why the founding fathers made this into the constitution is to stop the out rages arguing that was going on when electing the First president. It states in paragraph 3 ,\"The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.\" This shows that they didnt just make it to please one side of the argument, this pleased both side because it was very fare and didnt favor one side to the other. By doing this it nearly ended all of the arguing and controversy, which that is what they wanted to accomplish.\\n\\nfurthermore, the electoral college is good because why would you change something that has been working perfectly and helped the voting process out tremdously over hundreds of years. They have had voting for the President down to a science now, for example,\"The presidential election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first monday in november.\" paragraph 6 Everyone in the U.S. knows this date, it is imprinted in our brain when that day is and we need to clear our calenders and turn on the grill because that is a very specail day of change for our beautiful country.\\n\\nMany people say there are problems with the electoral college, then again there are problems with everything in this crazy world we live in. \"The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century.\" paragraph 11 Yes there was a crisis but to say that the electoral college is corupt and bad just cause of that fiasco is to far. America is too strong to break down from just that and there are to many belivers in the electoral college to have it just fall to peices from that one problem. It also shows the resliency of the electoral college, and not just that but also showing changes so that those crisises wont ever happen again. \"Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors...\" That is living proof that there are changes and fixes being made to further the effiency of the Electoral College.\\n\\nAll in all the electoral college has proven itself to be more then just helpful but it has changed America itself. It was made to settle a compromise made but it has settled more arguments then anyone can count. Its proven to the world it is here to stay and is not leaving anytime soon.Every 4 years, the first Tuesday in November. When its time for it, president elections is one of the most hectic times of the year. But what should the winner depend on? Electoral College should be removed by the government and just have popular vote be responsible. Electoral College can have electors go on the opposite candidates side so they lost a vote, which is just wrong. This argumentative essay will argue why Electoral College should be taken out by government.\\n\\nOne may say that Electoral College is the best system for voting, but then again that may just be the cheaters. Electoral College believers think that having electors go on either side to let one candidate win, is right. \"Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..\"Posner. So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don\\'t have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that \"when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate\\'s electors.\", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.\\n\\nEven though there are people who support the Electoral College, there are many people who are against it. In source three, Posner states \"it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.\"If one has gone through an election, theres a long process and hassle of being able to vote, but if people go through the craziness to vote, why not make the vote count?\"\"Faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.\"Plumer, paragraph 11. Not only are voters wasting their time to vote but the electors cheat. For example, if one candidate has the urge to win, they will send one of their electors to be on the opponents side so the opponent loses a vote that they believed would be theres. Electoral College also may not be fair to those in a small state. \"a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does...\", as said by Posner. Its not fair that even the people who vote from a small state, won\\'t really get recognized because there are bigger states to overrule, and even then, the electors will still choose who they desire. Electoral College is an unfair, and a cheating way to vote.\\n\\nTo conclude the argument, Electoral College should forsure be removed. Citizens favor popular vote over an electors vote. Candidates and voters enter a whole different threshold to express their political preferance. Why should the government even have voting if there really not truly being seen in the correct way. Citizens want to take a stand and vote in what the mind believes in. Take out Electoral College, and let the voters vote, actually count.Dear Senator [Your Senator’s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to you today as a resident, a citizen of the United States, and a concerned student. The issue that I urge you to consider is the controversy surrounding our Electoral College. It is firmly my belief that the current system, although imperfect and subject to criticism, serves a critical purpose in maintaining a balanced and fair electoral process in this diverse country.\\n\\nThe quickest argument against the Electoral College, as raised by Bradford Plumer, is to point out that it is not purely democratic (text 14). However, Judge Richard A. Posner noted that voting for electors, not directly for the president, provides some clear advantages (text 15). One of these practical reasons is the certainty of the outcome (text 18). While exact popular vote counts are essential for presidential elections, they can lead to prolonged and inconclusive debates when the margins are razor-thin, which was evident in the 2000 presidential election.\\n\\nAnother reason offered by Judge Posner to maintain the Electoral College is encapsulated in the phrase, “Everyone’s President.” For a candidate to win the presidency, appeal must be widespread and not just concentrated in certain regions or \\'safe\\' states (text 19). This prevents sectionalism and promotes candidates who address and understand the unique issues stretching from coast to coast.\\n\\nEven more, by urging candidates to focus on swing states, we ensure that a diverse group of thoughtful and engaged voters have a significant role in the outcome of the election (text 20). And, as Posner notes, the Electoral College gives some weightage to the larger states who suffer from a mal-apportionment in the Senate (text 21), which would increase without the Electoral College.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is not above criticism. It indeed does not provide an equal voice to all voters; it focuses overly on a few swing states (text 13), and can be potentially manipulated by \\'faithless\\' electors (text 11). However, the solution is not to completely discard it but to refine and improve it.\\n\\nI urge you, Senator, to consider the benefits that the Electoral College system offers to our country. Changing to a popular vote system may seem more democratic in theory, but in practice, it could lead to disproportionately amplified voices in densely populous regions, at the expense of smaller, less-populated areas. Let\\'s work to improve our current system, addressing its flaws and enhancing its advantages, rather than discarding it outright.\\n\\nThank you for your time, Senator. I hope you take these points into consideration when representing our state\\'s views on this critical issue.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]Dear State Senator, While I normally don\\'t have any complaints, and being the person I am not many things \"bug me\", but I recently found that I disagree with a certain argument. And while it is near voting times, I believed it\\'s best for me to send you my side on this continuous debate to change your mind on the matter. The electoral college has had its share of arguments and I would like to make my side seen knowing I have quite a bit of logical arguments. Please read with an open mind.\\n\\nThe electoral college is unfair in many ways, this one however can be seen as minor. The electoral college gives an easier way to get tie, and although a tie hasn\\'t been a main focus, it can prove to be a problem. I read an article stating that if a tie were to happen the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. This would anger a heap of people for many reasons, one stating it would almost rule out their vote.\\n\\nSecondly, the electoral college simply takes away from voting in general. An example of this is lets say Obama won popular vote, he should win because thats what America wants right? No, because what if another president won electoral vote? that president would win and take away the point in voting. This is unfair because we the people would like to have a better say in who becomes our president.\\n\\nIn the article I read, it stated \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. unfair, outdated, irrational\" I agree completely. How is it irrational? Well simply because it is just an extra step added on. In all reality our country would be fine without it. Popular vote is exactly what we need, and that alone is enough. And while I do believe it\\'s good to go an extra step, it shouldn\\'t go when not needed. This to me is most important because I could argue all day long and in the end this would be my argument.\\n\\nThank you for your time and please take this into consideration, I realize that it has its upsides but it is just unfair, outdated, and irrational. And please notice the other downsides swell, while I did not have the time or room to include them.Dear Florida Senator, As a citizen, i believe that the Electoral College system isn\\'t a very smart idea. If you think about it, it\\'s pretty unfair to us votes. We live in a country where they say that we have the right to vote. But in reality, with the Electoral College system in play, that right is taken away from us.\\n\\nBasica lly , when we vote, we don\\'t actually vote for the president himself. We are voting for the slate of electors, in hopes that they vote the way we would like them too. Although is is rare that an electors votes against his own party, it isn\\'t unheard of. That right there is a huge reason why we cant trust this system. We cant control who our electors vote for.\\n\\nIn worst case, there is a tie in the electoral vote and the election is thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegation vote on the President. Because each state only gets one vote, there would be only one person representing the 500,000 voters in Wyoming, and 1 person representing the 35 people that live in California. This is an unbalanced way to represent each state.\\n\\nBasically, the Electoral College is unf air to voters. Because of the winnertakesall system, candidates don\\'t spend much times in the smaller states because they don\\'t count for so many votes. They focus on the larger, \"swing states\" that will count for more. For example, during the 2000 campaign, there were 17 states that didn\\'t even get the chance to see the candidates at all.\\n\\nIn their defense, the Electoral College does avoids runoff elections. For example, in 1968 Nixon had only a 43 percent plurality of popular votes, but won the electoral vote. There is a lot of pressure when no candidate wins the people vote and this stress is reduced, which produces a clear winner.\\n\\nAll in all, the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and can\\'t be trusted. People who support it, need a reality check. They don\\'t realize that the system completely disregards their voting rights as a citizen.\"But America\\'s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling\", quote from the excerpt \"The End of Car Culture\", explains that people in the United States have started to become less dependent on cars. Not only Americans, but people all around the world such as people from Germany, France, etc. Reasonings for the recent drop in car usage is that there are problems with air pollution, bikes and other transportation that do not involve the use of cars also give place more space to make more town centers and sports complexes, and cars can be a very difficult machine that causes many problems for people everyday.\\n\\nSmog has become a very big problem for France. France has blamed diesel fuel as the reason for the smog problems. Diesel is favored more than gasoline due to a tax policy, diesel makes up over 67 percent of vehicles in France. The smog in France was so heavy that it, \"rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world\" according to an article by Robert Duffer. Smog is a very big issue that should not be taking place it can cause many health problems. France decided that the smog was getting out of hand so they began a \"Carfree day\", this meant that people would not be using their cars for a whole day and some people would not agree with this idea. France started these \"Carfree days\" with the people who had even numbered license plates and then the next day would have cars with odd numbered license plate would not drive their cars. The consequence for not following this rule was a 31.00 or 22euro fine. Many people were fined the next few days and twenty seven people had their cars impounded due to their reaction of the fine. This \"Carfree day\" helped to reduce the smog problem in France.\\n\\nWhen people use any type of transportation other than a car they would be able to have many more places to go and have a good time. When people are using cars and other motor vehicles they are also causing more and more construction for new roads and places for cars to be able to park. If people rode bikes and walked more than we would have more places for people to build shops and complexes that are all together and easy to get to. In Vauban, Germany most residents there live a life without the use of cars. \"The streets of Vauban are completely \"carfree\" except the main thoroughfare\", stated in the Article by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Only 30 percent of people in Vauban\\'s familys own cars, the other 70 percent do not own cars. More than half of that 70 percent sold their cars just to live in Vauban. In Vauban they have begun to create more sidewalks that are better accesible for bikes and walking. This has created more room for people to construct new stores and places that are walkable distance for citizens, so less car usage could lead to many new places such as shops, stores and even new sports complexes.\\n\\nCars can be very difficult machines that cause many problems for people everyday. They can just stop in a matter of seconds and people would not know what happened, causing people to get their cars checked out at a carshop and paying more money to get the problem fixed. If people began walking or using bikes as transportation they would not only be saving money but would lower the problems they would be having getting to and from places. Not using cars can save so much money for people because they would not have to pay much gas and they would not have to go to get their cars fixed almost every year. Even with bikes there might be a problem such as getting a flat tire or the chain popping off, even those little things would cost only a few dollars where as a trip to the carshop would cost a least 100.00 out of pocket.\\n\\nLimiting the use of cars can potentially save places from smog and more air pollution. Not using cars as much can leave more space for places to be built, instead of using the space as a parking lot people could use that space as a place for shopping or sports complex. Carfree day could even be a very helpful idea that might change the peoples minds to use other types of transportation besides a car. Having no cars could save a numerous amount of money for a lot of people. They will save money by not having to get a lot of gas and they will save money on not having to fix their cars almost every year. So limiting the use of cars could become a potential idea that can help people around the world.For years I\\'ve heard that voting time is the choice of the people. But with Electoral College, it\\'s not about the people it\\'s about the slate electors. When voting for what president the people want, they aren\\'t voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors. But if two people are going for president, and one wins the national popular vote but the other has more electors votes the one with more electors votes will be president. I think changing the election to popular voting for the president would be better than Electoral College, I\\'m not the only one that agrees.\\n\\nWhen voting time comes around you see a lot of publicity about each person running for office months before the actually voting time. And between that time of the publicity starts and to the voting date you are picking which person you want in office. You may do some research, listen to all the radio or TV interviews, andor watch all the speeches each person does. The whole time you are set on one person to be president. But yet you can\\'t vote for them, because of Electoral College. You vote for the slate electors, the electors vote for the president. Maybe your slate elector doens\\'t want that person, they can vote for the other runner. Voters can\\'t always control whom their electors votes for. Sometimes voters get confused on the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.\\n\\nTo pick a electors to depends on the state. Maybe it\\'s a state convention, state party\\'s central committee who chooses, maybe the presidential candidates themselves even. It\\'s not always the people\\'s choice on who is president. It has happened before, two people gone for president, one gets more national votes while the other has more electors votes. And of course, the one with more electors votes goes into office. Even though the people decided they wanted the other runner.\\n\\nDuring elections the runner for president tend to only pay attention to the more populated state such as California, New York, Florida, and Texas rather than the smaller states that have less number of electoral votes like Hawaii, Alaska, North and South Dakota, or New Hampshire.\\n\\nAccording to Bradford Plumer in \"The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and AFLCIO all agreed on getting rid of electoral college. Over 60% of votes would rather have a direct election to having Electoral College. They rather have a president win by popular vote than having slate electors vote on a president for them.\\n\\nVoting for a leader of your country should be the people\\'s choice. Not slate electors. It should be by popular vote, not Electoral College\\'s vote. I say listen to the people, vote on popular vote.Dear Senator, Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is \"an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.\" Posner Though the lack of control over the president of the United states election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.\\n\\nForemost, the EC as a method of backup to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter\\'s representation. As each citizen votes, heshe votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee. Richard Posner in his publication \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,\" states that, \"it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote.\" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, \"yet, that has happened very rarely.\" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a \"winnertakeall\" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one\\'s ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts hisher vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from hisher presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that \"the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population.\" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, \"practical\" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, \"the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,\" morally, his reasoning is spoton. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society heshe lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for hisher representatives pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that \"only educated voters should decide the election,\" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.\\n\\nLarge states also play a role in the EC\\'s inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of malapportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state\\'s population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.\\n\\nUnderstanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and coordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method.In a world of large cities and distant suburbs, transportation is crucial, but is personal transportation truly necessary? Shouldn\\'t there be a way of getting from point A to point B without expending an unnecessary amount of harmful gases that could one day bring around our demise? As specified by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky the answer to these questions is yes. Yes, there is hope for a healthier future without the use of bows, Toyota Corollas, Mercedes, and other modes of personal transportation that pollute the Earth. These answers have been noticed by our World\\'s leaders and they are finally taking initiative to save our planet.\\n\\nAccording to Elisabeth Rosenthal, writer for the New York Times, Germany is one of the many countries beginning to take notice. This is evident in the building of a small suburb called Vauban where \"life goes on without cars\". Although approximately 30 percent of the residents in Vauban do own a car, it is clear that the 5,500 people living in this small town are happier residing in a place where vehicles do not crowd the streets. As said by a mother living in Vauban \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\".\\n\\nThis idea of a \"car reduced\" community is not only seen in Germany but might very well soon be found in other countries such as the United States. These ideas today might just be seen by the public as what they are: ideas. However, serious action must be taken now. Although personal transportation might be seen as a necessity by your average citizen, it is not. Personal vehicles are a luxury that we use at, no only our own risk, but at the risk of everyone forced to breathe the intoxicating fumes of these polluting machines. According to recent data, 12 percent of green house gas emmisions in Europe come from passenger cars but this number is not nearly as shocking as that of the United States: 50 percent!\\n\\nAs stated by Robert Duffer and Andrew Selsky, writers for the Chicago Tribune and Seattle Times, Paris and Bogota have come to understand the consequences of the use of personal cars and are taking small steps to better the circumstances brought on to the human population due to the car pollution. In Paris, however, the city had to undergo a hard blow from reality for the french government to understand how crucial this change is. After suffering near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban on the driving of passenger cars in order to clear the air. If the ban was not respected by an individual, heshe would be forced to pay a 22euro fine. Although there were a few who did not follow the terms of the ban, the majority of the people did comply and the smog soon cleared.\\n\\nFor Bogota, however, the ban of passenger cars for a single day has been seen as more of a holiday. The people of this city have come to enjoy this somewhat stress free day away from cars. According to the Bogota mayor, Antanas Mockus, event the rain has not stopped people from participating in this day. This day is not as small of a step as you might think however. For it is a program set to spread to various countries where, for a single day a year, people will bike, hike, roler blade, etc. In other words, everything they MUST do to get from point A to point B.\\n\\nFinally, as countries around the world begin to take initiative towards the better of our planet, the United States, one of the world\\'s super powers is starting on it\\'s path towards recovery. In the past years, data has come to support the fact that there truly is a shift in the American \"way of life\". As seen in recent studies, Americans are buying fewer cars , driving less and getting fewer licenses as times goes on. Although the United States peaked in miles driven in 2005 it is evident that, with time, that amount gradually declined and hit a low in April 2013 where the miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak. As a cause of this sudden hit on the use of cars researchers are beginning to ask: could the United States truly be entering a new era away from the pollution of passenger vehicels or is this just another phase?\\n\\nPassenger vehicles and the gases they create could very well be the demise of our existence on Earth. This is unless, as a human poopulation, we begin to take action now. Although scientists everywhere have stressed the negative impact on the Earth brought on by cars, people are blind to see that these vehicles are not a necessity but rather a luxury. For this, it is crucial that countries and leaders around the world follow what others have done and begin to enforce the protection of the planet\\'s health and ensure our survival as a species.Hello, my name is PROPER_NAME, a freshman at SCHOOL_NAME. It is much appreciated that you took time out of your busy schedule to read this. This letter is in regards to the Electoral College. There have been many ongoing disputes on whether or not we should keep the Electoral College in order to elect the President. It is felt that the Electoral College is not the way to go when it comes to voting for the President. The reasons being for this is that the Electoral College doesn\\'t truly represent the people, and it doesn\\'t allow everyone to know the true facts about each candidate.\\n\\nFirst of all, the Electoral College does not represent everyone truly. The Electoral College is overall risky. It is stated by Bradford Plumer from the passage, \"The Indefensible Electoral College...\" , that there were several incidents regarding corrupt electors whom did not fulfill the popular vote of their state. He stated the incident in the 1960\\'s, when the Louisiana legislature almost replaced Democratic electors, in order to not have the popular vote go to Kennedy. Electors can also choose who to vote for and have no care in who the general public votes for. Why risk giving your voice to people who are shady, untrustworthy, and won\\'t care for your opinion? Furthermore, in the passage of \"What Is the Electoral College?\" , that most states have a \"winnertakeall\" system. However, in Maine and Nebraska, they use a system similar to \"proportional representation\". Why would the USA need this in order to choose a President? Why can\\'t things all be the same?\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College does not give everyone a chance to know the candidates a little better. In the passage, \"In Defense of the Electoral College:...\" , he states that candidates focus more on swing states instead of all of the states in general. This strategy creates a problem for those who want to listen and get to know who the candidates are, but live in states that don\\'t get visited. Which in turn, doesn\\'t allow the general public to get to know who they are. Another problem is that when the popular vote is lost in a state, those who lost no longer have a say in the election. Why have your vote squandered to the majority when you can have a direct election that will always give you a voice in your country?\\n\\nTo conclude, the Electoral College isn\\'t the greatest way to pick a President. The Electoral College should be abolished for it does not always honestly voice the general public, and does not give everyone to the same opportunity to understand a candidate\\'s motives. The Electoral College may give a clear winner and is less timeconsuming, but are we working towards a speedy election? Or towards what the people want? Over 60 percent of registered voters prefer a direct election. Which would you prefer Mr.Dear senator, Retain the Electoral College. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electors is is required to elect the President. Each state has hisher own electors which are chosen by the candidate political party. You should keep the Electoral College because you have certainty of outcome, and the President is everyones not just yours.\\n\\nThe first reason why you should stay with the Electoral College is because you are certain that the outcome will be in favor of one of the candidates. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote may happen but it is very unlikely that it will even though that 538number of electors in the Electoral College is a even numberS.3.For example in 2012\\'s election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to 51.3 percent of the popular cast for him and rodney because all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that stateS.3. However,because of the winnertakeall system in each state,candidates dont spend time in staes they know they have no chance of winning, they only focus on the close,tight races in the \"swing\"statesS.2. But, the winning candidates share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.\\n\\nThe second reason you should keep the Electoral College is because the president is everyone\\'s. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president by themselves. So for example,a solid regional favorite,such as rodney was in the South,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states he knows for sure that he will winS.3.A president with only his regional apppeal is very unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions may feel like there votes dont count or that he really isnt there president.\\n\\nIn conclusion, you should stay with the Electoral College simply because you most likely not going to have a tie and because the president is everyone\\'s.The advantages of limiting car usage has erupted since the year 2005. America\\'s love affair with vehicles has been like the love of their children. Most people cant get any where without a car they begin to believe that without a car you cat go anywhere, but if they look at the bright side America has many uses of transportation such as bus, train, plane, car pool, hiking, skating, bicycle, and walking. By using these ways of transportation many places around the world will find that is much easier then using a car everyday maybe if we tried to make these federal transportation toals in our city then maybe air pollution will decrease or even go away completely. There has been many improvement campaigns around the world such as Bogota\\'s day without cars and Paris\\'s driving ban due to smog. Many counties, cities, and states around the world are finding ways of transportation without cars and we should to. A world without cars is a utopia of a new way of living because many people are much happier this way.\\n\\nAs a result, to a world without cars Vauban, Germany\\'s people has said a life without cars is wonderful even if it takes a little more time to get places. \"As a result, 70 percent of vaughn\\'s families donot own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. \"When i had a car i was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainor and a mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor\"Rosenthal.3. According to Elizabeth Rosenthal\\'s statistic vaughn\\'s citizens are happy in this new way of life they have learned that a life without cars can be different but happier so that they can go through out their busy days without hearing the sound of an ongiong car zooming pass them as they walk the streets of their cities.\"vaughn\\'s streets a COMPLETELY car free besides the tram to downtown Feiburg and a few streets on the edge of the community\"Rosenthal.2. According to Elizabeth Rosenthal vaughn\\'s streets being car free is a easier life there is less traffic while trying to get to work in the morning, or even trying to get home, and picking up your kids in the afternoon.\\n\\n\"After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\"Duffer.10. Paris being near pollution has caused them to enforce a partial driving ban on its cities people. In my oppinion Paris going into over pollution would cause it population to die to the lost of many lives because of air pollution. After 5 days of intesifying the smog congestion decresased and there was many people rerouting their daily lifes to acounter the partial ban on their daily lifes. \"On monday many motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day\"Duffer.11. Almost 4,000 motorist were fined that day because they did\\'nt want to listen to a simple order. Due to the partial ban the congestion of motor vehicles decreased by 60 percent in the capital of france. This ban is a good way to take away the stress of putting gas in your vehicles, finding someone to fix your car when it has broken down and a possible cure to lowering the global effect of air pollution.\\n\\nAs a result, to America\\'s campaigns and organizations to keep U.S. drivers off the street and on public transportation the number of people driving and the number of people getting their license has decresased since 2009. Demographic shifts in the driving population has caused the population of many places around the world to stop driving cars and find new ways to get around. In the United States the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting \"car reduced\" communities and federal transportation toals, that mattering on its out come, may become a law throught the whole of the United States within the next six years. This law may cause many U.S. citizens to become upset because of the restrictment of something they use through out their daily lifes. Most people in the U.S. think that driving is the only way to get around but there are many ways of transportation mattering on where your going and how fast you want to get there.Cars have become an important part of our world. From their rising fame came consequences that effected our daily lives and our environment. Limiting car use can have advantages, like reducing greenhouse gasses and making ones community better to live in.\\n\\nBy limiting car usage, the amount of greenhouse gasses gasses produced by exhaust, carbon dioxide, etc. would be reduced. Greenhouse gasses effect the ozone layer of the earths atmosphere and that in turn effects the health of everyone breathing in the earths oxygen. Greenhouse gasses, albeit the healthy sounding name, is not good for people or the environment. By limiting car usage, people can put a dent in the amount of greenhouse gasses being produced. \"Passenger cars are responsible for for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States\" 5 This means people can change the world by simply reducing their car usage.\\n\\nChanging the way one lives can change the way they look at life. Some people in the community of Vauban have found happiness just by reducing their car usage. \"when I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\\' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two\" 3 In this community people get to experience walking down the street, hearing people instead of the constant sound of a running car. \"In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.\" The people living in the community don\\'t have to go out of their way to buy something when they can just walk down the street and purchase it. The town of Vauban entertains the choice of efficiency and health over inconvienence and unsafe air.\\n\\nLimiting car useage can have many advantages, like reducing greenhouse gasses and making one\\'s community better. Although cars are convienent the people in the town of Vauban would rather live in a reduced car community.Title: The Benefits of Reducing Car Usage: Learnings from Global Initiatives \\n\\nAs we navigate our way through the 21st century, the pressing need for reducing carbon footprints becomes increasingly evident. Cars, once the symbols of freedom and status, have become major contributors to environmental pollution and climate change. Several global initiatives offer compelling evidence on the benefits of limiting car usage. \\n\\nVauban, a suburb in Germany, presents an intriguing model of a virtually \"car-free\" community (Rosenthal). With careful planning that prioritizes pedestrian and bicycle transportation, Vauban has achieved a significant reduction in car ownership. A majority of the residents reporting higher levels of satisfaction and happiness due to reduced stress associated with car usage and maintenance (Rosenthal). This approach has reduced the community\\'s carbon emissions, contributing to environmental conservation and fostering a healthier lifestyle among its residents.\\n\\nSimultaneously, cities like Paris and Bogota have experienced firsthand the benefits of limiting car usage, albeit through enforced measures. When Paris had to enforce a partial driving ban due to high pollution levels, it consequentially led to a 60% decrease in the city\\'s congestion and a significant reduction in smog levels (Duffer). Bogota\\'s annual \\'Day Without Cars\\' has also exposed millions to the benefits of alternative transportation, lowering air pollution and enhancing public transportation use (Selsky).\\n\\nHowever, these efforts are not limited to the urban and suburban landscapes. Rosenthal\\'s article, \"The End of Car Culture,\" highlights emerging behavioral shifts in the United States. The decrease in car ownership and miles driven per person suggests a long-term cultural shift, triggered not just by economic downturns but demographic shifts and changes in lifestyle preferences (Rosenthal). The increasing acceptance of telecommuting, city-centric living, and alternative commuting methods such as carpooling or shared van services, points toward a future that is less dependent on personal vehicles (Rosenthal). \\n\\nThese global initiatives provide convincing evidence on the ecological, economic, and lifestyle benefits of reducing car dependency. Lower emissions, improved air quality, less congestion, and public health improvements are among the immediate benefits observed. However, these efforts must be supported by well-structured urban planning that encourages alternative means of transportation and legislation that supports such changes.\\n\\nTo reshape our cities and societies towards sustainability, a shift in our perceptions of mobility is required. Perhaps a future where cars are seen as occasional necessities, rather than daily essentials, can pave the way for sustainable urban living that harmonizes with the environment rather than working against it. Above all, embracing this change will not only help preserve the planet for future generations but will also fundamentally improve our present quality of life.Cars have always been a big part society it takes us from home to work to home again. However, people fail to realize that driving cars is damaging our earth. We don\\'t have anywhere else to go if we keep killing earth. The government should take action and try to get the people out of cars and on bicycles.\\n\\nIn Paris, the government banned certain cars to drive on certain days. In Robert buffer\\'s article it explains which cars are banned, \"On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered tro leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day.\" Paris takes action in hopes to help their air pollution. The smog was so bad it \"rivaled Beijing, China\".\\n\\nVaugban, Germany tries an experiment. They make a suburb with real people, going to real life jobs without cars. This is one of the first carfree cities and it was great. Life continued, people still breathed, society was advancing without any help from a cumbersome vehicle. Not only did this city help with air pollution but it got people up and outside! People walked or used bicycles to get to where their were headed. Exercise is the one thing almost everyone pushes off but now with no cars you have to get that exercise in order to get to work! Mother and media trainer, Heidrun Walter said \\'\"When I had a car i was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\"\\'.\\n\\nEven in Bogota, Colombia people believe \\'\"It\\'s a good oppertunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\"\\' Eventhough Germany didn\\'t allow a single car, Colombia did allow there to be public transportation only busses and taxis. The people are happy and content with this simplistic lifestyle, so much so that other cities have joined the event! This goes to show that society doesn\\'t need cars. We can take control of our life but lately we have been letting technology control the way we live.\\n\\nElisabeth Rosenthal believes it to be \"The End of Car Culture\". What do you believe? Are you happy with the life you are living now? \"Has America passed peak driving?\".Dear, state senator I think we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think this because the Electoral College does not seem fair, the president that usually wins in popular vote loses to the vote for presidency, it is considered a nondemocratic method for selecting a president, and it is all up to the electors of a candidate. The Electoral College should also be changed to popular vote because it is not the people who are choosing the president, it is the three electors sent from each different state.\\n\\nThe Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is not fair to the candidates. This is because most presidents that win the popular vote section of the election then end up losing the presidential vote section, an example of this is when candidate Al Gore received the most individual votes when running against George W. Bush, but Bush won the electoral section, receiving two hundred and seventyone against Al Gore\\'s two hundred and sixtysix. The Electoral college is also unfair to voters, because of all of the states winner takeall system of government, and in seventeen states they did not get a chance to see the candidates. Most people believe the Electoral College is outdated and irrational, a person named Bob Dole, believes that the Electoral College should be completely abolished. Another big problem in the Electoral College is segregationists who do everything to go against certain parties and their candidates, like the time in 1960 a group of segregationists almost succeeded in their effort to get rid of all democratic electors so that new electors would be opposed to John F. Kennedy.\\n\\nThe Electoral College should also be changed to election by popular vote, because people consider it nondemocratic. This is because the voting is all up to the electors selected by each of the different states, meaning that the actual people of the state have no power in the election of the candidates for president. When the people of the state take their vote for the candidates they are actually voting for potential electors who will then go represent the selected candidate, this gives rise to problems like corrupt electors who are dishonest and using cheating tactics, also most states know that their votes will do nothing to help the candidates being represented, examples would be the Democrats in Texas and the Republicans in California. It is also believed that the Electoral College makes potential voters not want to vote at all and they end up not representing their candidates. And most people already have a certainty of the outcome of the election, meaning they already know who will win the election based on the number of votes so far in the popular votes section and the electoral section. The system of electors is also not fair because the people can not control who they are voting for has the electors, and the states number of electors are equal to the number of people on its congressional delegation, which gives big states an advantage over small states.\\n\\nTo conclude this letter, I again say that the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote because, popular vote is fairer then the Electoral College, the people have no power compared to the electors and the are subject to corruption with in the system.The presidenit is our leader.

Shouldn\\'t the man or woman with the most popular vote be the president? It isn\\'t fair for the people because if more people want that particular person elected then why shouldn\\'t he be elected? He has more people on his side after all doesn\\'t he? These are all questions you should be asking yourself because you as State Senator have the power to abolish our states Electoral College system. There is in fact several great facts about why we should do away with the Electoral College system. Three of them might be that the electoral College system isn\\'t fair between all 50 states, the winnertakeall system isn\\'t fair towards voters, and also the \"disaster factor\" is completely wrong. The Electoral College system is a despised part of our should be fair elections.\\n\\nOur senator have you seen how the electoral vote works? According to the third paragraph in bradford Plumers writings called \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" it clearly states as a very valid point that the Electoral College voting system isn\\'t doing it\\'s job. To be precise the voting isn\\'t up to the people at all. What happens is that we the people all go and vote for a president and one obviously has the popular vote. What happens is that the electors put our votes in and say we have mabye three hundred thousand people voting from our state and well you see we don\\'t get that many Electoral College votes towards the president we want. Then say another state gets mabye two hundred thousand and that side has the more people in it\\'s state then us and then they get more electoral college votes then us but we had the more people. Does that seem very fair to you? To continue from there we have the WinnerTakeAll system which basically does what the name applies which is that if say one side gets mabye ten more votes towards one canidate then that side gets all the Electoral votes towards that canidate and does that seem right to all the other people just because they got 10 more votes? No it doesn\\'t and its a crime towards all the other people who voted for the other side. Next theres something called the \"Distaster Effect\". The \"Disaster Effect\" is basically that the electors don\\'t have to put in the popular vote. The electors who are chosen by the state legislature actually look at all the votes and vote for a canidate. The more electors that put in a particular vote win and they take all the electoral votes dude to the WinnerTakeAll system. The catch to that is the elecotors actually don\\'t have to use the pouplar vote and they can vote for whomever they want to be elected. This is not for the people at all and not even close to it.\\n\\nNow that I have given completely valid reasons can\\'t you see that the Electoral College voting system is biased to serve only the goverment and a few select people. If you used the popular vote system everyone could vote for whom they choose and then we would have fair elections so the true canditate of the people is chosen.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nCar usage has become deeply ingrained in our society, but there are growing movements around the world that are promoting the idea of limiting car usage for a variety of reasons. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can have a positive impact on the environment, improve public health, and create more livable communities.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for up to 50 percent of emissions in some areas of the United States. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, walking, and cycling, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint.\\n\\nIn European countries like Germany and France, efforts have been made to create car-free communities. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, has successfully implemented a car-free policy, with only limited parking spaces available at the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move into the community. Residents have reported feeling less stressed and happier without the burden of car ownership.\\n\\nThese car-free developments are part of a larger movement called \"smart planning,\" which aims to separate suburban life from auto use. The idea is to create more compact communities with better access to public transportation and amenities within walking distance. This approach not only reduces reliance on cars, but also creates more vibrant and livable neighborhoods.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can also have a positive impact on public health. The smog problem in cities like Paris has led to partial driving bans, with restrictions on cars based on license plate numbers. During these driving bans, congestion decreased significantly, and levels of particulate matter in the air were reduced. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can improve air quality and reduce the health risks associated with pollution.\\n\\nIn addition, reducing car usage can improve physical activity levels. By walking or cycling instead of driving, individuals can incorporate exercise into their daily routines, leading to better health outcomes. Car-free initiatives, such as the annual car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, have been successful in encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation and showcase the benefits of car-free lifestyles.\\n\\nOverall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote physical activity. By creating car-free communities and implementing policies that support alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future. It is time to reevaluate our dependence on cars and embrace new ways of getting around that are better for both our environment and our well-being.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nDear [Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to share my thoughts on the Electoral College and whether it should be kept intact or changed to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. After carefully examining the information from various sources, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained for the following reasons.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As noted by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the chance of a dispute over the outcome is lower compared to a popular vote system. In the 2012 election, President Obama received a much higher percentage of the electoral vote compared to his share of the popular vote, illustrating the stability of the Electoral College.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College system promotes a sense of national unity by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents a candidate with merely regional support from being elected and ensures that the interests of all regions are represented. In a diverse country like the United States, it is important to have a president who can bring the nation together and consider the needs of all citizens.\\n\\nFurthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the election results are uncertain. This focuses campaign efforts on key issues and allows voters in swing states to be more engaged and informed. These swing states represent a cross-section of the country and the opinions of their voters should thus hold more weight in determining the outcome of the election.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College provides a fair balance between large and small states. While the Senate\\'s mal-apportionment gives smaller states a disproportionate advantage, the Electoral College restores some of the weight to larger states. This ensures that presidential candidates must consider the concerns and interests of states with larger populations, rather than solely focusing on the needs of smaller states.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College always produces a clear winner. This avoids the complications and costs associated with conducting run-off elections, ensuring a smooth and efficient presidential election process.\\n\\nIt is essential to consider the counterarguments against the Electoral College, such as the alleged unfairness to voters and the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the presidency. However, these arguments can be addressed through reforms and improvements within the existing system, rather than scrapping it altogether.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College is a valuable institution that promotes stability, national unity, and fair representation. While it may not be a perfect system, its advantages outweigh its disadvantages. I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College and explore possible reforms to address any concerns raised by critics.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take my perspective into consideration when making decisions regarding the electoral process.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Dear Senator, I, STUDENT_NAME, am in favor of changing our democracy to popular vote. Electoral college does no good to our society. It\\'s out of date, it\\'s irrational, everybody in this case has a great chance of becoming president. That is no good, we do not need idiots running our country. Election by popular vote is the best way to go. You will have a certain outcome and votes will be fairly made. It benefits everybody. More than half of our population wants you guys to make the switch.\\n\\nThe electoral college is not an up to date voting method. Our founding fathers made it many years ago while writing the constitution. It is a long process of nonsense that has no advantages to us, the people. By popular vote, it\\'s faster, simpler, and better. Popular vote is basically a group of qualified citizens voting for the president. Popular vote is the best way for people to directly voice their opinions by picking the president of their choice. If we use the Electoral college, the electors of our state may not deliever it properly.\\n\\nOver 60 percent of voters prefer direct elections. Government officials such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and others all thought we should abolish the electoral college. Many things are wrong with the electoral college, we don\\'t directly vote for the president but for the slate of electors, who eventually vote for the president. It in no way benefits the people, they have no control over who the electors pick. In many cases, people have decided to not even vote because there was no hope.\\n\\nIf there are greater chances of everybody being president, not only is there a fool running the country,he isn\\'t going to worry about your interests or needs. If your own president won\\'t help your interests, potential voters may be turned off. Isn\\'t that horrible, to feel that our president isn\\'t our president? Knowing that our vote will have less of an elect, we won\\'t want to vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who have something to say and actually want to express themselves. They are not the people who don\\'t care and just vote to vote.\\n\\nYou and the rest of the senate should consider this very deeply. It isn\\'t just benefiting the people, but congress, the whole senate and most importantly, the president. It will make us a better nation and one as a whole. I hope you take this into great consideration and make the change. The only way to get back the peoples trust and votes is by taking baby steps. This is one great step and good things may come out of this.Have you ever wondered what will happen if we keep using cars as a means of transportation? All the air pollution, killing the atmosphere, wasting valuable resources. The future is going to be a place where we can\\'t even breathe in air without having a mask on our heads due to smog. Going green as in limiting cars is a tremendous idea for the communities, and for the planet for various reasons. No smog in the atmosphere, greener communities, and more beneficial ways of transportation. Once you go green you will go never back.\\n\\nTo start off, Smog is one of the main disadvantages of owning or being in heavily populated area where they use cars frequently. Smog is when the cars emit there gases out of there tailpipe, and get trapped in the atmosphere causing people to have problems breathing. Articles in the city of Paris in France said that they had to ban cars due to the smog in the atmosphere. They hit a near record of air pollution and stopped people form using there cars on certain days to clear the smog from the atmosphere. On that five day period of the intensifying smog actually rivaled the place of Beijing, China which is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Once the smog cleared they rescind the ban of car usage only to be a the same place there are going to be now if they keep on using cars.\\n\\nIn addition, cities around the world are creating new communities where they are not allowed to use cars. In Vauban, Germany the residents there are in a set up where they cannot use cars in there everyday life. 70 percent of the people over there do not own a car and 57 percent sold their car just to move into the community. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\" said Heidrum Walter, a resident of the city. Other places in the world like in Bogota, Colombia is in a program that they cannot use cars in there life. The life were they are no cars is a good life for a community and for everyone else.\\n\\nLastly, the end of transportion is not done, but people are finding new ways of transportation. Newer ways of transportation has stared in New York they have a bikesharing program has skyrocketed. As well as car pooling since only one car or van is being used rather than 4 of 5 cars it is more efficient. People in the United states are using these ideas in there everyday life. Sutdies have shown that are less likely to get their drivers liscense and get a car. The world will be in a better place without car usage.\\n\\nTo summerize, limiting car usage is a extrodinary idea to make the world a better place. To cease the air pollution of smog, to make greener communities, and to make efficent ways of transportation.Many people in the world today think that cars and driving everywhere is a necessity however, many people feel that owning a car is \"impractical and undesirable.\" paragraph 43 There are many advantages to having cars, but there are also many more advantages to not using cars wherever people go. Some advantages include conserving resources, making people have a little more money in their pocket and it also improves safety in many suburban cities.\\n\\nIn the world today, a major problem that still exists is greenhouse gases. Cars emit a lot of gas that isn\\'t good for the environment. In the first source, it says that people living in cities \"is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe... passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent...in Europe...and up to 50 percent... in the United States.\"paragraph 5 Exports mean to say that it is better for people to live in cities so they don\\'t have to drive everywhere. This means that the more people that live in cities, the less gas goes into the air. In Paris, the city issued a ban for driving to try and reduce the smog. The second source says that \"congestion was down to 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog.\" paragraph 14 Only after five days of the no driving ban, more than half of the smog was gone in Paris. It also says that the amount of smog was almost as polluted at the city of Beijing, China, which is the most polluted city in the world. Bogota also did the same thing. They have an event called \"A Day Without Cars.\" Participant Carlos Arturo Plaza says it is a good way \"to take away stress and lower air pollution.\"paragraph 24 They also got other cities, and even other countries, to follow suit and join the event. America faces the same problem as Paris too many greenhouse gases are being put into the atmosphere. President Obama has a goal that he wants to achieve and that is to try and make the environment healthy. The last article says that driving less \"will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants.\"paragraph 34 This implies that the amount of gases let into the air will be reduced. If peolpe didn\\'t drive as much from place to place, the world would be a happier, healthier place.\\n\\nApart from the fact that cars give of gas, not driving everwhere also means people save more money. In Vauban, Germany, nobody has any cars, they walk or bike to wherever they need to go. \"Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the egde of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home.\"paragraph 2 People would be more inclined to not getting a car rather than spend an extra 40 grand on top of getting a house for a parking space. Also, in Paris, a fine was issued for people who drove their cars during the car ban. The second article says \"evennumber license plastes were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine..\"paragraph 11 If people didn\\'t drive their cars around when they weren\\'t supposed to, they would still have the 22 euros they lost. The same type of fine was issued in Bogota, Columbia. If people drove their cars on \"A Day Without Cars\", then they would have to face a 25 fine. However, in the United States, \"recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.\"paragraph 29 Without having to pay for a car or gas money, Americans are saving way more money they had been when they first got a car. Wit people not having to worry about payments or gas prices, they have more money in their wallet.\\n\\nNot only does not driving save money and reduce gas, it also improves cities and people\\'s lives. Heidrun Walter, a German media trainer, says that \"when she had a car, she was always tense. She\\'s much happier this way.\" paragraph 3 She likes not having to drive everywhere, it makes her feel more calm and less tense. It\\'s not only changing peoples lives, but it\\'s changing the cities. Cities are attempting \"to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with eless space for parking.\"paragraph 6 Cities are changing their apperance in order to intice people into driving less and walking or biking more. They intend to make the stores closer together rather than having to drive across the highway to get to the next store. Also in Bogota, there has been a \"cunstruction of 118 miles of bicycle paths\" and \"parks and sports centers...have bloomed throughout the city.\"paragraphs 27&28 With more people walking, the city wants to make the outside apperance different and more appealing than what it looked like before people just used cars. Not driving is not only good for personal well being, but for the a city\\'s well being.\\n\\nThere are many advantages to driving cars, such as saving time and getting to places faster but, not driving cars is way better in the long run because of a better environment, saving money and better cities and personal health.Cars in this century are being band for multiple reasons. To most people, cars are a hastle and a pain to deal with. Advantages to limiting car usage are the less parking areas and more community buildings, the reduction of smogpolution, and more exercise for Americans. Most cars are getting better with the limitation on gas and more on battery, but we should still limit cars in general.\\n\\nIf you walk along the streets in New York, you will see that along every sidewalk there is a parking strip and around every corner there is a parking lot. What if those parking spots were gone? We could have larger and more store then we have now, plus we could have larger sidewalks to bike and walk on. In Vauban, Germany, generally street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden. The house owners are allowed to own cars, but transportation is limited due to the limited parking areas. Suburban inhabitants mainly use a source of public transportation because of how cheap and easy it is.\\n\\nSmog is a fume that comes from cars and lingers around that area. It makes the whole area fill up with gas that it looks like a huge fog bank. China is the worst contributor to smog due to all its factories which make cars. Paris is trying to limit the amount of smog in their area so they restricted the use of cars for five days. After the five days, Paris cleared up and the people there were able to see a lot clearer.\\n\\nAmerica is known to be a fat country. All the people in American sit around and eat everything, are really lazy, and rely to much on machines. If we cut down on machines, including cars, a whole lot of Americans would lose a lot of weight. Larger sidewalks would help a whole lot for bikes. Bikes would give you exercise and help you be self relient instead on relying on the car. A professor at The University of Michigan has a son who lives is San francisco, who he says has a car but never uses it. He always uses the public transportation, and why\\'s that? More than likely it is because in San francisco the traffic changes rapidly and you don\\'t know if you will hit bad traffic. Also, San francisco is a beautiful place to be, and he may want to enjoy the view in that area.\\n\\nCars have taken over the United States in many ways that we know about but don\\'t care or don\\'t do anything about it.. America and everwhere else could have a lot more stores and get more exercise if parking lots, parking spots along the sidewalk, and some cars are gone. Smog is not a good gas to have lingering around where a whole bunch of people are walking and living. Cars are great, no question, we can live a healthier life if we didnt have them.\"The day that mankind realizes that their creations destroy the true beauty of mother nature it will be too late.\" This quote by one of our nations greatest political and environmental activists, Irvin Green, directly applies to the topic of reducing pollution. One simple, yet extremely effective way to reduce pollution is limiting the transportation methods we travel by. Limiting car and vehicle usage can reduce pollution, nearly eliminate accidents, and makes the road a safer place.\\n\\nIn many places such as Germany, Paris, and Columbia, many ambitious ideas are being put into play to help battle pollution. In the article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", it is stated that in Vauban Germany, 70 percent of families do not own vehicles. The other 30% that do, do not have a place to park them, making them basically useless. Residents in Vauban have stopped their need for transportation, making malls and stores a walk away. In this new approach, pollution has drastically reduced in numbers and has made it a much safer and cleaner place to live.\\n\\nThe usage of vehicles are a doubleedged sword. They may get us to where we need to go with plenty of time to spare, but what are we really losing because of it? What we are losing is the environment and also our health. In Paris, the pollution rate almost reached a new record high, thus forcing the partial driving pan to clear the air of the global city. In the article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", its evident that cars hurt us in more ways then we realize. businesses are suffering due to the lack of transportation available to delivery their services as seen in source number two, \"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue\". \"Congestion was down 60% in the capital of france after fivedays of intensifying smog...\" The smog was so dense that Paris officials created a law making evennumbered license plates to leave there cars at home to reduce pollution. With half of the normal amount of cars driving, it almost elimated the total accident rate, making the road a safer place to be.\\n\\nDespite the benefits that come along with transportation, there are more disadvanges then advantages. Pollution is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions just behind power plants. Many sociologist have seen these statistics and have also noticed that American transportation usuage has slowly been declining since its peak in 2005. People are slowly but surely helping the cause in their own ways, whether its by delaying getting there license, limit there driving, or even carpooling with friends. Limiting car and vehicle usage can reduce pollution, nearly eliminate accidents, and makes the road a safer place to be.Cars are a part of everyday life. You use them to drive to school, to work, out to eat, or to the movies with all of your friends. But what if you didn\\'t have cars? What if you werent allowed to use them? Many places around the world, like Europe, Colombia, Paris, and even some parts of the United States, have started to end the car culture. This has proven to be very beneficial in keeping the earth clean, safe, and and healthy.\\n\\nGreenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes in cars have been a big culprit in pollution. In paragraph 5 in the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" it states cars are responsible for 12% of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in widely used car areas in the United States. In Paris, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear their air after nearrecord breaking days of pollution. Paris has more smog than other European capitals, having had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter, which compared to other paces like London, who only 79.9, that\\'s a lot of smog. With limited driving, the pollution will decrease and benefit the environment over time.\\n\\nNot only does the limited use of cars increase the overall health and safety of Earth, it helps keep us safe too. Multiple car accidents happen every single day around the world. As you would know, without cars, there would be no car accidents. Accidents such as these can be caused by traffic. When driving on the highway with cars surrounding you, all going 70 mph, there\\'s a high risk of getting into an accident. During France\\'s partial ban of cars, the congestion, or car traffic, was down 60% than normal. This lessened the chance of accidents and made the roads more safe, for both driverspasangers, and those walking along the streets.\\n\\nSince cars would no longer be in use, how would you get around? In Columbia, many citizens hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during their car free day. Without the use of cars, Americans and others would actually get up and move to get to where they need to go, which isnt something that\\'s common anymore. America is the most obese country in the world, with most of the top obese cities residing in Texas. Cars give us another excuse to not be active in our everyday lives. If everyone had limited use of cars, everyone as a whole may get the daily exercise they need to say at a healthy state.\\n\\nAlthough cars are useful to get us to the places we need to go fast, they are not required or needed. They let off gases that are harmful to our environment, can be hazardous to ourselves and others, and should be replaced to play against obesity and unwellness. The cons of cars outweigh the pros and everyone should be turning off their cars and stepping outside.America was built upon the foundation known as democracy, yet we have been desecrating on what we believe in for years. I am talking about the electoral college, the process of picking a president or senator through voting for what an elector decides on and acts as a representative for what a certain region decides to vote for. From the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral vites by Congress.\" I do not believe that the electoral college is a wise decision as it being the process of voting for our next leader.\\n\\nMany people disagree with my opinion and there are a few reasons why, that even I support. From the article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president,\" by Richard A. Posner, he states that the outcome is certain when applying electoral college to a vote, while a dispute can be more likely to occur using the popular vote method. However, the electoral college can even decrease the percentage of voters in the country. There are Democrats in Texas while California has Republicans. This means that there are electors who already know what they\\'re voting for and the candidates only visit \"swing\" states or states who have no preference on what party they are voting for. This will decrease the chance of voters to vote in a state that already knows what party the electors of their state will vote for.\\n\\nI agree on the basis that vote by popular election is more applicable to the situation of voting rather than by electoral college. One reason is the messup that occurred on the presidential election voting in 2000. The problems of the electoral college is the reason why Florida screwed up and George Bush became president rather than Al Gore, who won the popular vote. Taken from the Article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,\" by Bradford Plumer,\"Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They\\'re not alone according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote, but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" Another reason as stated by Plumer\\'s article,\"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" What would happen if there is a tie on the votes the elector gets? Would the elector simply choose one or the other or might not even vote at all. I also believe that it is unfair that each state gets the number of electors based on the population of the state. If California was Republican while Idaho could be for Democrats, then both do not have an equal value because California has more people. Overall, electoral college seems sophisticated but whatever happened to being \"plain and simple?\".\\n\\nVoting through the popular vote method seems much easier and much better than voting within a certain region counts as one vote. It would be much simpler if every vote of every single person counted as it\\'s own vote for the president, not for an elector. This makes your vote not seem that worthy and is the cause of discouragement of voting. From the Office of the Federal Register it states that, \"Most states have a \"winnertakeall\" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" There is proportional representation or statistics involved, simply who gets more takes it and it would be unfair to each person with this method.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the electoral college is an outdated process for electing a president and should be changed to whoever, wins the popular vote because deepdown, the people are the key figure in voting. With this process, you are undermining you, your state, and even your country by continuing with this absurd and unnescessary process when it could be all voted and decided, \"by the people and for the people.Thier are a bunch of reasons for not using a car I can name you 10 off the top of my head. It limits pollution saves money great excerise their multiple reasons not to drive a car everyday.\\n\\nFor example if you limit your car use to 3 times a week you would save a ton of money. Also you would help get rid of pollution as it states in the article \"Pairs bans driving due to smog\" that congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france after 5 day of intensifying smog. That happened after five days the smog cleared up enough and they let people start driving again. Also if you limit your car use you could start doing some excersie which is great because the rate of obesity may drop. Also if you limit your self from driving you are less likely to be in a car accident.\\n\\nIn the passage \"car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" that they for one whole day dont use cars. They instead ride bikes every where because they want to reduce smog as Pairs wants to. In the passage it says that since its such a big hit that two more colombian cites, Cail and Valledupar joined the event. They have built over 118 miles of bike paths, the most of any latin American city, according to Mockus, the city\\'s mayor. It also says that \"the rain hasn\\'t stopped people from participating,\" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Also that day lets people probaly enjoy life way more because all you can do is ride bike and walk so they probaly go on adventures.\\n\\nThe final reason why you limit car use is their would be less of a chance for you to get hurt or even worse. Thier are many accident evey year because of drunk and reckless drivers many have lost their lives to idiots on the road. Thier was a story on the news that three teenage kids died in a car accident because they where under the influnce of drugs. They could have hurt other people the reporter said they crashed into a store and the store owner almost got hurt. Those kids almost took someone else life which is scary but if you limit your car use their wont be that many accidents.\\n\\nAll in all if you just limit your use of the car you can be helping out a bunch. The pollution can be reduced not as many car accidents you can save your self some money. Also you can get more excersie in if you dont use your car that often.Cars have been the main focus of development for many years now. Engineers attempt to create sufficient cars every time a new model is planned. Many citizens of the United States are slightly aware of the environmental damage that is caused by the cars, yet still do no think twice when it comes to driving anywhere. Many countries around the world have set fines and laws against using cars and have seemed to produce a positive outcome. These countries offer many different alternatives to using cars, creating a well developed society.\\n\\nWhile cars are a huge advantage to modern day society, they take a big toll on our environment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the Company, cars are the \"second largest source of America\\'s emission\" proving how much we rely on cars source 4 paragraph 34.She also writes about numbers terrifying to the future generations. United States is responsible for 50 percent greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe while Europe is only responsible for 12source 1 paragraph 5. 50 percent is proof that Americans are too reliable on transportation sources like streets, main roads, and highways. Paris was able to clear the air from pollution. According to Robert Duffer from the Chicago Tribune ,after enforcing a driving ban, the air cleared after an almost record setting pollution fog source 2 paragraph 10. Places in Asia like Beijing, China are just filled with smog in the air. The citizens walk around with masks because of the heavy pollution. That is physically dangerous for not only the adults, but the children of the communities. There has to be some alternatives to using cars in excess. Almost anything can be an advantage but when it is used too much, it will always be dangerous.\\n\\nEven though cars are important to commerce within society, many alternatives can be taken to help lower the usage of cars. In places like the capital of Columbia, they have found a way to travel places and limit the car use. Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle Times , speaks of this matter. He claims that there has been \"construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths\" in the city of Bogota source 3 paragraph 27. Not only does this allow the citizens to be environmentally friendly, but it gives them a chance to exercise, which leads to better health. It is noticeable the the healthier people tend to be more lifting than the sluggish, corpulent citizens. In Barcelona, Spain, being a vehicle owner is simple undesired. Other means of transportation like walking or bicycling have been the desired means of getting places. Even Bill Ford, the chairman of Ford Motor Company, admits to the impractical use of cars in excess. There are some many different ways the we can reduce the use of Cars in the American nation.\\n\\nWith the ability of using bikes to arrive at destinations, many places have seen the improvements in reduced traffic jams. What Americans hate the most are traffic jams. Think about those times when 10 minutes have slipped away in the morning and you are running late then there is a traffic jam. Millions in Columbia participated in hiking or biking and it left the street nearly empty source 3 paragraph 20. The citizens were smart enough to recognize when they need a car. When going to work that is only 5 miles away, they take the extra time to reduce the usage of the streets. France experienced the same result, reducing traffic congestion by 60 percent, and then lowering the smog that had covered them source 2 paragraph 14. This leaves the street safer for drivers and pedestrians. It also reduces the heavy noise from motored vehicles.\\n\\nMany nations have improved their societies by reducing the use of cars. In result, the air pollution is reduced, the health benefits improve, and the traffic congestion is heavily reduced. Not only can reducing our relience on cars benefit our genertaion, but it can benefit the generations to come.Limiting car usage can have many advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided offer insight into the benefits of reducing car dependence, including improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased accessibility to public transportation and alternative modes of transportation. By limiting car usage, we can create more sustainable and livable communities.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on air quality. According to the passage about Paris banning driving due to smog, the temporary driving ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and improved air quality in the city. The passage also highlights the negative effects of diesel fuel, which is a major contributor to air pollution. By reducing car usage, especially cars that run on diesel fuel, we can significantly reduce air pollution and improve the overall health of our communities.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The passage about Vauban, Germany, mentions that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce our reliance on cars and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. This is particularly important in light of President Obama\\'s goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, as mentioned in the passage about the end of car culture.\\n\\nLimiting car usage also leads to more accessible communities. The passage about Vauban, Germany, describes how the community is designed to be car-free, with limited parking spaces and a focus on walking and biking. This creates a more compact and pedestrian-friendly environment, where shops, services, and public transportation are easily accessible. Other examples, such as the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, show that alternative transportation options can be successful on a larger scale. By creating communities that prioritize public transportation and active modes of transportation, we can increase accessibility for all residents and reduce traffic congestion.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. It improves air quality, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and creates more accessible communities. The passages provided highlight the success of car-free initiatives in various cities around the world, demonstrating that it is possible to live without cars. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and designing communities with pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, we can create more sustainable and livable cities.Dear Senator Adams, Voting for a president is not what it seems to be. The electoral college makes the people\\'s votes so that the electors are actually voted. These electors vote for the president in favor of their party which is not always trustworthy or reliable. The popularity winner can also lose, due to lack in electoral votes. Many voters are still confused or don\\'t know how the system works. In reality, electoral system is outdated and should be tweaked of how it would work today.\\n\\nTo begin with, Electors that are voted for by the people are not always trustworthy. They\\'re hand picked by their political party but sometimes,\"state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are...\"Does The Electoral. Voters can\\'t control who their electors vote for president. The electoral college should be changed to popularity votes because, \"the electors could always defy the will of people\"The Indefensible Electoral. This is unreliable and the way of voting by the people can be easily swayed by the electors.\\n\\nAdditionally, the popularity winner can lose by having less electoral votes. Voters can be discouraged to elect their president when really the electors do the job. This situation has happened when,\"Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes\"In Defense Of. Any election, voters can expect another close election in which the popular winner could again lose the presidency. The electoral college is unstable and this major downside is a factor.\\n\\nMore over, many voters are still confused or don\\'t know how the system works. In this article it states that, \"voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate\"The Indefensible Electoral. The electoral college does not clarify to voters on what the people are actually voting for. In another article it explains that people actually voted for a slate of electors. This would mean that the author had to reassure the right understanding. Readers of that article who\\'ve voted are now in disbelief or shocked.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the electoral college should be addressed to a win by popularity. The electors in favor of their political party are not always trustworthy. The popularity winner can lose due to lack in electoral votes. Also, many voters are confused or don\\'t know how the electoral college works in presidential elections. These facts add on to more cons than pros of the idea of electoral college.The using of cars has caused much of the worlds green house gas imitions, in America as much as 50% of the imitions are caused souly by transportation. Many people feel that this is destroying our atmosphere and that we should cut down on imitions by walking, biking or car pooling. Efforts to cut down keep our atmosphere clean and breathable. Some communities such as Vauban, Germany have illuminated car use entirely.\\n\\nVauban is a new experimental suburb where there is no street parking or driveways and the only place to park is in a garage where you must buy a space for 40,000 which has cut the car ownership rate down to only about 30%. There are as many as 5,500 residents in Vauban and most of them say they like it much better without having to worry about a car. In many suburbs however the houses are much to far apart for them to be carfree, though many areas are considering developments like this one so they can clean up the air.\\n\\nOther cities, such as Paris, are forced to ban driving for days at a time in order to clear the thick smog that hovers above the city. On one day odd numbered plates won\\'t be allowed to drive and on the next day even, volaters are fined 31. As many as 4,000 drivers are fined. Only once the smog was sufficiently cleared did they allow both plate types to drive. Limiting driving can prevent problems like this from occurring in all cities.\\n\\nIn Colombia they have a day where all cars are banned, chalanging the inhabitance to find alternate routs of travel for fear of the 25 fine for violators. The day without cars began in the mid1990\\'s for Bogota, a city with a population of 7 million, has participated, but last year two other cities in Colombia joined in. Dispite the rainy weather many people still hiked or rode their bikes. Many citizens say that it keeps the cities air clear and that its nice to have a day without traffic jams filling the streets. The Day without cars is an event that many countries hope to adopt.\\n\\nStudies show that many people from the newest generation aren\\'t bothering to get a licence. Cell phones and apps make car pooling easy and the internet allows you to interact with friends without having to drive to visit them. Experts are hoping this trend will continue and that it will cut down the gas imitions. With increased use of social networking technology hopefully people will also become more aware of how they are affecting their planet and move to help others cut down as well.Dear Senator, I have recently read some interesting information about a process of voting called \"The Electoral College.\" It seems to work quite well in favor of getting the \"right votes\", however I do agree that there are too many possibilities and factors that could go against the public viewsand be in better favor of the government. As I recall, the government was set up for order and protection of the people. I am young and most people would probably judge the fact that I am so young to be stating things as politicalas this, however, I do seem to fathommore about political issues like thisand other things than most adults even know. Judging by the unbiased information I was given that shows me two sides of the issue, I\\'d say that though The Electoral College seems to work, there are so many factors that favor the government rather than the people.\\n\\nOn one hand, yes. The Electoral College does seem to work. It gives a fair amount of Electors to each state due to their Congressional Delegation and we are given the information that we, The People, are voting on the Electors rather than the President but there are too many factors to that. We must take into full recognition that electors do not have to be faithful toward the end to the President they were going to vote for in the beginning. We must also consider the fact that the Electors are people not in public Office. I am assuming that means that they must work for the government rather than in the public. I must state the possibilitythat there could very well be some possible, underhanded things going on in the government for the assurance that a particular Presidential Candidate is chosen to win the election, all based on the fact that they are chosen by the Electors. This came to mind because of paragraph 11, under \"Source 2: The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong.\" Within this paragraph, it stated that the Electors need not be faithful to the President they said they would vote for in the election. As well as this, the government was made for the people and the people hardly seem the get an advantage with the Electoral College since we have to trust a group of human beings that could very well be unfaithful.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Electors not sticking to what they said rarely happens Or so we are told. As well as that, the Electoral College seems to work well and has a certainty of the outcome and avoids \"Runoff\" elections. However, the government was made for the public and therefor, I do believe that the people should choose their president as long as everyone is completely informed with uncensored information aboutb how everything is run, what that President, as well as what Congress and the other branches of Government intend to do whilst the current President is in Office. Many people don\\'t even bother with trying to understand the way our government works and just completely trusts and goes along with whatever the government tells them but I think that is wrong!For a healthy government and a happy population, everyone must be informed with uncensored information and understand the outcome of these actionsand how it willl affect them in the shortterm and longrun. It is difficult and takes longer than what everyone would like but who wants to live in a so called \"Democracy\" that looks like a form of Oligarchy. Given the information I read, it doesn\\'t seem fair or right. it seems like a form of control a form of Oligarchy a lie.Many places such as Vauban, Germany have given up the usage of cars. Vauban is a goring trend in europe and the United states because of the positive effects of not using cars. One of the biggest examples is polution, also the removal of cars would ultimately lead to a financial increase in our economy, lastly making this change positively effects our future.\\n\\nFirst I would like to talk about a huge problem we face as a society today and that is green house gasses. You may not think that these are a big deal put if left unchecked they can become a huge problem. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe, and up to 50 percent in carintensive areas. This can become a huge problem ranging from acid rain to climate change. An example of what polution can do to a city is in paris they are putting a partial ban on cars because of how how bad there polution is. There was a huge smog problem because green house gasses were being trapped because of hot days and cold nights.\\n\\nAlso this change can have amazing effects on that areas economy. Because there will be no cars people will take the bus witch is less than paying for gas or they can walk to closer places. Also gas prices would decrease for other forms of transportation because there wouldnt be cars demanding the fuel. family could sell there cars and spend the money they were using to fund there car other thing witch will lead to the people being happier. Also the removal of cars will lead to the creation of jobs because they will need people to operate public transportation.\\n\\nLastly the removal of cars will have a positive effect on the future of our world. With the track were on now the world is estimated to heat up and have negative consequences on our society. these climate changes may seem small but they can have drastic effects. in china there is a lake that is so polluted you set the top of it on fire because there is so much pollutants on it. also this chang has coralation with peoples happiness. Were already started down the path of less cars, recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.\\n\\nFor the following benefits is why we should stop using cars and continue with the idea of using public tranportation and walking. Cars creat polution, its better for our economy to stop the use of cars and this will poitivley effect out furute.Humankind has always been fascinated with the concept of cars. Motorized vehicles that effortlessly take you from one area to another when compared to more traditional methods such as walking. Everyone wanted a car for themselves to become a part of the innovation. But as time has passed, we now realized that it was naive of us to think cars were going to revolutionize transport, as some of the more simpler ways of transport bike riding, bus outshined car ownership in practicality and efficiency.\\n\\nNow more than ever, alternative transportation methods are being promoted heavily in order to reduce the amount of pollution in the atmosphere. A shining example of this is in Paris, France \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", source two, where the government took the initiative to limit the usage of vehicles to reduce the amount of smog in the city.\\n\\nParis, one of the most idolized cities in the world, was at a point where the density of smog and pollutants in the air rivaled Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. However, after the driving ban in Paris, the city saw a drastic reduction in the amount of pollutants in the air, as it dropped down from 147 micrograms of particulate mattercubic meter. Not only that, but Paris also saw an improvement in car traffic, dropping down to 40 percent of what it originally was five days after the ban.\\n\\nWith all this in mind, how does this benefit the population without looking at the pollution reduction? This can also benefit us physically and psychologically. In Bogota, Colombia, a generally congested city, filled with traffic jams and other problems Mayor Antanas Mockus promoted alternative transportation in the \"Day Without Cars event\"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, source 3. In an effort to encourage public transportation in the city of 7 million inhabitants, Mockus promoted an event in which the only form of motorized transportation available was taxi cabs and bus rides. This mean that the people took the opportunity to bike, walk, hike from one point to another. Subsequently, this also indirectly promoted physical fitness and a stress release for people wanting to take the chance to enjoy their day. As Carlos Plaza evidently states that it is a great way to take away stress, while on a bike ride with his wife. Colombia has also opened up new bike path, parks, and sports centers, which is all the more proof that this initiative is promoting physical fitness and psychological wellness.\\n\\nOne could argue that this revolution of alternative transportation could have negative consequences on car industries and other businesses that rely on personal vehicle, and they wouldn\\'t be wrong. But this phenomenon doesn\\'t necessarily have to hurt anyone, as these same industries can promote their time and resources on projects that also promote alternative transportation. Just as well, in recent years, the amount of people getting driver\\'s licenses and relying on personal vehicles has seen a significant decline, such as the amount of young prople driving decreaed 23 percent from 2001 to 2009, or when a study showed the amount of miles driven by the average American peaked in 2005 and steadily declined since then The End of Car Culture, Source 4. People started to see the efficiency of alternative transportation, and capitalized on the opportunity to make transportation more accessible to everyone. Whether its from the expanding bicycle paths in New York City, to the Bay Area Rapid Transport in San Francisco, these are just a few examples of the steadily growing list of cities promoting more accessible transportation.\\n\\nSo with all of this in mind, there is irrefutable evidence that the more simpler methods of alternative transportation to limit vehicular usage is more efficient and practical. As seen in Paris where the city saw a significant drop in the amount of smog the city contained. Or when Bogota where an event that banned vehicular usage promoted physical and psychological wellness. People opting for alternative transportation is the global phenomenon that benefits us in more ways than we can imagine. There\"s no doubt that the older, more traditional methods of transportation out perform personal vehicles in efficiency.Car uaage around tohe world ia cauaing an increaae in pollutoion, greenhouae gaa, and obeaitoy.

The electoral college has a system that can be considered confusing to most americans. This system indirectly transfers citizen\\'s votes to congress. This allows for loopholes and sabotage to be commited during the process of electing a president.\\n\\nBack in 1960. segregationalists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.\\n\\nsource 2, second paragraph.\\n\\nThis is stating that in 1960 people who opposed Kennedy nearly became his electors. So if they succeeded in becoming his electors his votes would have gone to another opposing candidate. This could not happen with a system of voting that directly connected everyones votes with congress. This was a clear case of sabotage in the election of 1960.\\n\\nVotes in larger states and smaller states are balanced out so the number of votes would not be based on the number of people in the states. This can be seen as a way to make sure that state votes did not compare to the population of said states. In reality it is limiting the votes of citizens. If people ignored how larger states had more people than smaller states and just thought of everyone as individuals everyone would have a say. The system I am proposing does not view states as the voters, but every american citizen as one. After everyone passed their votes, they would all be tallied and which ever candidate had the most votes would win.\\n\\nYou may think that the votes could be sabotaged, and that politicians could put in fake votes and get rid of real ones. This problem could be dealt with by maximized security. There would be videocameras wherever the votes could be swaped.\\n\\nI propose this system to ensure that every citizen has a vote, and that corruption while transitioning the votes would be eliminated. This would be a less confusing system that could make voting more efficient.Dear Senator,\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to engage with you on the polarizing American electoral system, specifically the Electoral College, and the ever-present dialogues surrounding its sufficiency and equity.\\n\\nThe U.S. Constitution conceived the Electoral College as a compromise between a Congressional election process and direct popular vote. It offers a practical set of benefits that protect small states and maintain balance in the democratic process. Judge Richard A. Posner, a noted scholar, underscores these benefits, detailing five reasons to keep the Electoral College. It offers certainty of outcomes, necessitates the winning candidate to have trans-regional appeal, directs campaign efforts towards swing states, provides counterweights to the malapportionment of the Senate, and avoids run-off elections.\\n\\nThe electoral system demands a candidate to build a broad appeal beyond regional boundaries, assuring that the president will not be a regional favorite but a representative of the nation as a whole. It keeps the candidate focused on varied issues, a facet seen in the attention given to presidential candidates in swing states. Further, the winner-take-all approach and the balanced attention given to big states ensures an efficient electoral process and reduces the need for expensive, cumbersome run-off elections.\\n\\nWhile these benefits are significant, critics argue that the Electoral College fails to reflect the will of the populace and point to instances where the popular vote winner lost the presidency - George W. Bush’s victory over Al Gore in 2000, for example. Others argue that the allocation of campaigns focused on swing states leaves voters in decidedly red or blue states feeling marginalized, and that the potential calamity of a tied electoral vote is a looming threat to democratic reliability.\\n\\nDespite the concerns, what’s worth noting is that instances where a president was elected without a popular majority are rare. The Electoral College system, however imperfect, ensures that the president has broader appeal, thereby representing the diverse interests of all Americans, not just those in densely populated cities or regions. Furthermore, the prospect of tied electoral votes, while concerning, is infrequent and not enough to warrant a complete overhaul of the electoral system.\\n\\nThough the popular vote appears to be a straight democratic process, it is crucial to remember that it would shift the emphasis primarily onto densely-populated metropolitan areas, thereby disregarding rural areas and small states. Given America\\'s ethnically, economically, and geographically diverse populace, the Electoral College, for all its imperfections, ensures a balanced representation.\\n\\nIn closing, I make an appeal for a bipartisan examination of the Electoral College, where potential avenues for enhancement can be explored. However, a complete shift to a popular vote is not in the collective best interest of all States within our Union.\\n\\nI thank you for your time and await your response.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n[Your Name]There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Decreasing the amount of time citizens use personal motorvehicles positively impacts the environment and the state of mind of people. The lack of driving personal cars is becoming more widely accepted in several countries for different reasons. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, is an experimental district testing the lifestyle that does not use cars. Paris banned driving for environmental reasons, and Bogota decided to try it out too. Also, it is a trend in America for the purpose of saving money and because there are other convenient options.\\n\\nThe decrease in fumes from cars is very beneficial to the environment. People and organizations are making drastic efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. According to paragraph five of \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" twelve percent of greenhouse gas in Europe is caused by passenger cars and fifty percent in some areas of the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting \"car reduced\" communities because emissions from cars contributes to half of the pollution in America. In the Article by Robert Duffer, \"Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog\" he describes the event that Paris had to declare a ban on half of the drivers because the large amount of smog that lingered over Paris. Colombia even has a day dedicated to being free of cars to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. All of these events show the severity of environmental problems caused by cars and people making efforts to promote a better environment.\\n\\nAlso, a decrease in personal motor vehicles causes people to have a better state of mind. Heidrun Walter states, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" With a car comes a lot of responsibility which leads to a lot of stress on a person. Not having a car is one less bill to pay and thing to take care of which for many people is a better way of living.\"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" stated Carlos Arturo Plaza on carfree day in Bogota, Colombia. The car free day has also promoted other things to bloom in the city such as parks, sidewalks, and restaurants that people really enjoy. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article \"The End of Car Culture,\" her children have other priorities than recieving their license because they have other things they would rather focus on that they enjoy more. All of these things promote people living a healthier and happier life.\\n\\nOverall, limiting car usage is a \"winwin\" situation for everyone. Decreasing fumes and the stress of a car causes the environment and people to be happier. Promoting public trasportation or other ways of getting places is better for everyone. It is a growing trend all over the world, and for a good reason. A lack of fumes from cars will clear the air, and clear the minds of fellow citizens.The electoral College is something in the United States that needs to be replaced. It is an irrational system that takes the people\\'s power to vote away from them. The system has flaws that leave the possibility of disaster open to happen. It takes the power to choose the government officials from the people, and gives it to a group of people who can vote either way. Why would we keep this?\\n\\nThe electoral College is a way to choose the Presidential candidate who wins the election. It involves a slate of electors according to Source 2 who cast their votes in. The people in each state vote for the winning electors of that state. The electors pledge to a candidate and thats what people vote for. Once the people choose a winning elector group they go to Congress and cast their votes in for who they want, and that person then gets so many votes. The problem is that the electors aren\\'t required to vote for who they said they would, so if the elector suddenly decided to change his mind after he or she won, the people\\'s votes are basically invalidated and a different elector gets the votes. This effectively removes the people from the equation in who gets elected. All an elector would have to do is win over the people, then he or she could just change their minds and cast a different vote than what they said they were going to do. The people who vote don\\'t even vote for the Presidential candidate in this system, they vote for a bunch of electors that they hope will vote for what they said.\\n\\nThis is not an irrational, unrealized fear. It has actually happened before. According to Source 3, in the 2000 election, Al Gore had a majority of popular votes, but less electoral votes, so he lost to Bush. This isn\\'t even the first time it has happened, it has happened previous times throughout U.S. history. This is a clear example of how flawed the electoral College system. Between the possibility of the people\\'s votes not counting for anything, and that they don\\'t even actually vote for their preffered candidate, this system needs to be replaced.\\n\\nSome may argue that the chance of an elector not casting his or her vote that he pledged to is very slim. Why would you even be ok with taking such a chance? It\\'s better to be onehundred percent sure of what will happen instead of ninetyfive percent. Also, since most states in the U.S. award electoral votes by a winnertakesall basis according to Source 3, if one side of the votes wins, even by a slim margin, they get all the votes. This seems unfair, since if they won by a slim margin at least some of the state thinks it should be a different vote. It would make more sense if the states awarded both sides of the vote if it was a close win for one side or the other, but they would award the true winner with more votes than the narrow loser.\\n\\nAnother problem with the E.C. system is that states that are largely of one belief Republican or Democrat ect. have no real reason to pay attention to the opposite side of the canidacy. Since the state would be largely one thing or the other, it is irrelivant if thirty percent of the state votes one way if seventy percent of the state votes the other, since the landslide victory style of electoral vote giving is present in most states. This also means that states that are biased and small states get almost no exposure from the opposite side of the canidacy because they know they have almost no chance of winning their votes. This seems to force the voters to choose one candidate\\'s electors because they don\\'t know enough about the other.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the electoral College needs to be replaced with a more fair, balanced system. It has the potential to allow the electors to defy the will of the people who voted them in, invalidating the people\\'s votes and making them pointless. It also has candates only focusing their ads and visits on the states with more votes and the states biased towards their party. Finally, it has almost all the states have a landslide \"winnertakes_all\" style of awarding electoral votes. This means if one side of electors only wins by a slim margin, the other side gets nothing, even though since they lost by a small number they clearly have a sizeable amount of voters for them. The electoral College needs to be removed before someone takes advantage of it\\'s serious flaws and takes the votes of the people and makes them useless.Work. School. Party. No matter what you have on your to do list you still have to get there, so why are car sales going down and how is it beneficial to our society? Teens and young adults can often be heard discussing what brand of car they one day hope to buy and all the modifications they will make to trick it out. Many people though end up being 20 or older before they actually get that car they always talked about, and despite parents claim of laziness there could be more to it then that. So what advantages could there be to a world with fewer cars on the road?\\n\\nThe first topic that is at the forefront of the minds of most people just starting out their new life is cost. The world revolves around money, thats just the way it is, so many people are finding themselves cutting out things that they don\\'t really need. Now I know what your thinking but before you begin your argument that you really need that blue mercedes you saw in the magazine think about just how much that cost compared to your last paycheck, not so exiting anymore right? With public transportation becoming more and more available many people are choosing to take the public bus rather then buy their own car. Another thought is all those taxes you pay. What you thought they went to police and teacher\\'s wages and building nice little parks for the kiddies? Well according the environmental Protection Agency 80% goes into making Highways and other transport, and why do they need that much money? Because we drive 100 tons over them every day. Many of the more polluted citys are even beginning to put laws into place banning or restricting traffic in some areas and placing fines on those who violate them. Between the purchase price and patience as well as gas and the money used to fund roads and highways theres a lot of dough pouring into your car drives.\\n\\nNow heres the topic I know your all tired of hearing about but its still very important, the environment. Car emmisions are the second biggest source of pollution in the atmosphere, first place going to powerplants and third place being cows, yes cows. Is a world blanketed in smog and smoke where the very air that sustains you is poison the kind of place you want to live in or, for that matter, raise kids in? Its not the the planets health we\\'re talking about here its the health of everything living on it including us. While we\\'re on the topic of health one of the greatest health issues in America is obesity, now imagine if everyone left their cars at home and walked or biked instead, the whole country would be healthier then ever before. And you know how when you go into the country the air smells so nice and clean, well that could be the city too if we just cut back on emmisions, we could have nice fresh air as well. Now think of your children, or friends or even yourself, just outside playing football when a car comes by and almost hits you, dozens of people die every day in car crashes that wouldnt if there were less cars on the road. So think of the health of your familly, your friends, your pets, and yourself.\\n\\nFinally we have the cultural shift, many Americans are already choosing to carpool take public transport or even just walk and less and less are buying cars. This trend is so noticibly prominent that car companys are trying to come up with new ideas and products to keep their customers coming. Citys are coming up with new systems of bike and car borrowing as well as a partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which \"Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and imporve safty\". So for those of you that can\\'t stand to be left behind by the times jump on the band wagon and you can do your part to bring about a new cleaner era in the world.\\n\\nCars, the parasprites of a modern age, keep multiplying and destroying more and more. The emmisions given of by these monstrosities will linger more many a milenia poisoning the air we breath and devastating the world out children will inherit. Unless we do something to stop it now this travesty will continue to ravange all life on the planet untill we are on the brink of extinction, so do us all a favor and help to push this new trend of a car free world.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage \\n\\nLimiting car usage can have a number of advantages for individuals and the community as a whole. The passage set provides evidence of this trend happening in different parts of the world, including Germany, France, and Colombia. In these places, efforts have been made to reduce the dependence on cars and promote alternative modes of transportation. Limiting car usage can lead to a cleaner environment, healthier individuals, and better community planning.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease the amount of pollution being released into the environment. This is particularly important in densely populated areas like cities, where air pollution can have severe health consequences for residents.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can have positive impacts on individual health. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, mentions that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work on that particular day. Engaging in physical activity like walking or cycling instead of driving can help improve cardiovascular health and overall fitness. It can also reduce the risk of obesity and related diseases.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to better community planning and more efficient land use. The passage about Vauban, Germany, describes a community where street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden. Instead, emphasis is placed on public transportation and walking. This approach makes it easier for people to access amenities and services on foot and reduces the need for large parking lots and sprawling developments. Compact and walkable communities can promote social interaction, reduce traffic congestion, and improve quality of life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage can have a range of advantages for both individuals and communities. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, promote physical activity and better health, and lead to more efficient community planning. As the passages suggest, these efforts are already being implemented in different parts of the world. It is important for individuals to consider alternative modes of transportation and make choices that contribute to a cleaner and healthier future.Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can positively impact our lives and the environment. Car-free communities, such as Vauban in Germany, demonstrate how reducing reliance on cars can lead to happier, healthier, and more sustainable communities. By adopting smart planning strategies, suburbs can become more compact and accessible to public transportation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. In Europe, cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while some US areas have rates as high as 50 percent. By limiting car usage, we can directly reduce our carbon footprint and mitigate the harmful effects of climate change.\\n\\nMoreover, car-free communities promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. When cars are no longer the primary mode of transportation, people rely on walking, cycling, or using public transportation. This increased physical activity can lead to improved cardiovascular health, reduced risk of chronic diseases, and better overall well-being. Additionally, car-free communities enhance social interaction by creating vibrant streets, where people can walk, cycle, and interact with their neighbors.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of air pollution. Cities like Paris have enforced partial driving bans to combat smog and improve air quality. Car emissions, particularly from diesel fuel, contribute to high levels of particulate matter in the air. By reducing car usage and promoting alternative transportation, we can lower air pollution and create healthier environments for everyone.\\n\\nLimiting car usage also has economic benefits. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting \"car reduced\" communities, and legislators are starting to prioritize public transport in transportation bills. By investing in public transportation and making it more accessible, communities can reduce transportation costs for individuals and families. Additionally, car-free communities can repurpose land used for parking to create more vibrant and economically productive areas.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By adopting smart planning strategies and promoting alternative transportation, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more vibrant and economically productive communities. As more car-free communities emerge and people embrace alternative transportation options, we can move towards a more sustainable future.Many places around the world are limiting the usage of cars. If more places created regulations like these, it may drastically change the environment, for the better.\\n\\nVauban, a suburb in Germany, made conditions in the neighborhood almost impossible to own a car. While it may seem like an annoyance, many of the residents are happier this way. According to Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, \"When I had a car I was always tense, I\\'m much happier this way.\" While many people may see having to give up or not use their can an annoyance, if they get used to it they might find that not using their cars may be a good thing.\\n\\nInstead of having to hear car engines and honking horns, they can take a relaxing walk or even a bike ride somewhere.\\n\\nLimiting car usage would also be very helpful in cleaning up the environment. In \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" the author states, \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in carintensive areas in the United States.\" Limiting the amount people can drive their cars could reduce a hefty amount of pollution in our air. In France, they limitied the amount of people who were allowed to drive for two days. Paris has more pollution in their air then most European cities, but putting regulations on who could drive significantly reduced the amount of smog in just a few days, according to Robert Duffer.\\n\\nPutting regulations on car usage can also make the area you live in a much nicer place. In Colombia, a few cities have an annual \"Day Without Cars\", where citizens are fined for using their cars. As a result, things like restaurants and malls have been being built. They are repairing more sidewalks and building new bicycle paths. Parks are being used more often. The communities would be much nicer places with out the frequent use of cars.\\n\\nLimiting the use of cars is a very good thing. It helps the environment, and it helps make the world a nicer place.Dear, state Senator Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not visited or spoken to from the president other than small states. Sources from source 2: The Indefensible Electoral college: why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumet. Reason 1 explains that many electors could ruin the president campaign and Reason 2 states many elector go for big states to cast in more votes other than small states.\\n\\nMany may not realize but when they vote they\\'re not voting for the president, they\\'re voting for state electors, for example \"each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee\" although each party chooses a trusted elector many can betray the party and select the other party. Also the betray can cost the presdient election dearly for instance Bradford stated \" back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. kennedy.So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy\". In other words the electors can ruin the president campaign and may cost most of the states problems.\\n\\nThe electors want to cast in more votes from big states other than small states. Source 2 quoted \" Because of the take all system in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states. Even though you would like to vote for your campaign the electors may not even visit other sates because they may think the other campaign has a better shot at getting more votes, but they do not know that maybe spoken words for the president may get more votes. also many may not even see any ad for the campaign, for example \" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn\\'t get to see a single campaign ad.\" The author explains that many electors don\\'t even see most staes because they are small states and they may not get as much votes compared to larger states.\\n\\nElectoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not visited or spoken to from the president other than small states. Electoral college may seem an unfair disadvantage for most voters many of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors, many electors may betray their campaign because they\\'re not pubilicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that many voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the matter of the voter and the United States of America. In my opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campagin whose better and meet our daily bases needs.Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today with the intention of sparking a discussion on a cornerstone of our democratic processes - the Electoral College system we use to elect our President. Currently, the system plays an instrumental role in dictating the dynamics of our elections. With this letter I urge both the retention and a critical review of the Electoral College system, showcasing both its merits and demerits in balancing our political landscape.\\n\\nIn line with the preamble of our Constitution, which calls for a more perfect union, the Electoral College ensures equitable representation of all states, irrespective of their population sizes. As pointed out by Judge Richard Posner, the electoral college system gives every region the importance it deserves and reduces the potential of regional marginalization (Passage 19). Posner also argues that the electoral college\\'s winner-take-all system fosters certainty of outcome, reducing potential disputes that might stem from popular vote counts (Passage 18).\\n\\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that the Electoral College, as is, does not come without an assortment of drawbacks that need addressing. Bradford Plumer outlines the disaster factor, highlighting how the Electoral College sometimes overlooks the will of the majority (Passage 11). This denies the electorate their democratic right to choose their leader directly - instating a layer of complexity where the populace votes for electors instead of the presidential candidate (Passage 10). Furthermore, this system often sidelines voters in stronghold regions, as candidates mainly focus on swing states (Passage 13).\\n\\nThe critiques suggest a need to reform, not necessarily dismantle, the Electoral College system. As we maintain the system’s advantages in upholding every state’s importance, we need to revise its mechanisms to make voting more transparent, democratic, and inclusive. For instance, moving away from the winner-take-all approach and adopting the proportional representation practiced in Maine and Nebraska could offer a middle ground (Passage 7).\\n\\nIn conclusion, a democratic republic such as ours needs a balance of both direct democracy and republic representation. Hence, before we completely abolish or keep the Electoral College as it is, considerable thought and discussions need to envelop these issues. I urge you, as our state senator, to initiate these discussions and represent our views on this matter. \\n\\nSincerely, \\n[Your Name]Cars, the pride and joy of many people. They may look nice and go fast, but they hurt the environment more than most people would know. If Americans in certain places used public transit or walked, air pollution would go down by 50% in those areas. It would be better for the environment, and for the human body\\'s health to reduce the amount they drive in their personal car.\\n\\nTo begin, cars are the second most cause of air pollution in the United States behind power plants. Since the end of World War II the U.S.A has been idolizing cars, and they have been focusing on the production of these cars. In Vauban, Germany there is a ratio of 3 to 10 people who own cars. Only 30% of the population owns a car, which is saving the air from quite a bit of pollution. Another event that will help lower pollution would be banning driving cars for a day or two. In Paris, there was so much smog that it was compared and even rivaled Beijing, China which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. The people who drove their cars on this day would be fined 31 American dollars. The public transit was free of charge because it was being promoted to use, as it helps the air become less polluted. This event also happened in three Colombian cities, Bogota, Cali, and Valledupar. The ban on the cars made many people seem to be happier, and more energetic. This ban has been happening for three years now in Bogota, and other Latin American cities are now seeing the importance of it. The use of bicycles, the public transit, or even walking helps reduce air pollution in your city.\\n\\nIn addition to not using personal cars, walking from jobs or to the mall has seemed to make many people in these driving bans less stressful and much happier. From government officials to the commonfolk of the street, all of the Colombians in Bogota look much happier. Even rain hasn\\'t stopped them from biking to work. One woman in Vauban, Heidrun Walter, said, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" She does not own a car and lives a happy life. She even sold her car to move here, along with 57% of other families who live in the town. Not only does the relaxation of not driving make you less stressful, it also makes you get more excersize. Since 70% of Vauban\\'s families do not own cars, we can assume that they are one of the healthiest cities in Germany or even the world. If all cities in Europe were nearly identical to Vauban then they would have only 3% greenhouse gas emissions from cars, but they would also have a much lower rate of obesity. Even in some parts of the United States, car emissions would go down by 50% which would, in turn, cause obesity to go down by a gigantic number as well. The use of bicycles and your feet would greatly reduce obesity along with increasing happiness.\\n\\nAlthough some people may argue that people who don\\'t own personal cars will use public transit instead and societies without personal cars will not have a decreased obesity. This may be true, but if people use public transit then they are helping the environment even more than themselves. They would still have to walk to and from the bus stops. Which will decrease obesity although it may not be in as big of numbers as we would like.\\n\\nIn conclusion the absence of personal automobiles would greatly reduce the air pollution in most major cities. Beijing could become it\\'s once beautiful city, and Paris wouldn\\'t have to ban driving because of thickened smog. The United States would also never have problems with smog, and we would also reduce air pollution by 50%. Communities like Vauban and Bogota are prime examples of people who do not need cars to survive. They are stress free, and much happier than most car driven societies. Personal cars do much more harm, than good. This is why we do not need to rely on the use of personal cars.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n\\nSubject: In Favor of Maintaining the Electoral College\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College system for the election of the President of the United States. This unique process, established by our founding fathers as a compromise, ensures a fair and balanced representation of all states. While some argue for a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College has many advantages that should be considered.\\n\\nTo begin with, the Electoral College provides the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner argues, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This eliminates the possibility of prolonged disputes over close election results, as we have witnessed in the past. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could potentially lead to endless recounts and legal battles, undermining the stability and integrity of our democratic process.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the interests of all regions of the country. Each region has a different set of concerns and priorities, and it is imperative that our elected leaders take them all into account. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal in order to secure the necessary electoral votes, the Electoral College encourages presidential contenders to address the needs and concerns of voters across the entire nation.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College system gives attention to swing states. In competitive elections, candidates focus their campaign efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain. This means that voters in these states are more engaged and informed about the candidates\\' policies and positions. By allowing swing states to have a significant impact on the election outcome, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful and informed voters play a crucial role in deciding the president.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the Electoral College is that it restores balance between large and small states. The malapportionment of the Senate, mandated by the Constitution, gives small states a greater say in our legislative branch. The Electoral College allows large states to regain some influence by rewarding them with more electoral votes. This balanced approach ensures that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account during presidential campaigns.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. This system guarantees that a clear winner emerges from the election, even if they do not secure an outright majority of the popular vote. This helps to streamline the electoral process, preventing the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections.\\n\\nWhile critics argue that the Electoral College discourages voters in states that are heavily skewed towards one party, the fact remains that nearly half of eligible Americans cast their vote in the most recent presidential election. Voters see their participation as an opportunity to express their political preference, rather than believing that their individual vote will single-handedly determine the election outcome.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College system has proven itself to be a vital and effective method for electing our president. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages attention to swing states, balances large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These advantages contribute to a fair and stable presidential election process, and therefore, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College.\\n\\nThank you for considering my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the arguments for and against the Electoral College in making your decision. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]All around the world air pollution is a major problem, most everyone knows that. However, there is one thing that a lot of people do not know. They do not know that they themselves are contributing to polluting the very air that they breathe. Car usage is an enormous contribution to the pollution going into the air and is a problem all around the globe that needs to be drawn attention to. This essay will help to prove to my fellow citizens that limiting car usage has huge advantages and should be carefully considered for our community.\\n\\nIn the first article, In German Suburb Life Goes On Without Cars, it informs you about a town called Vauban located in Germany. This town is involved in a movement under the name of \"smart planning.\"Thisthe attempt to \"separate suburban life from auto use.\"Since street parking, driveways, and home garages have generally been banned, \"70 percent of the towns families do not own cars.\" It goes on to tell you that \"passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States.\" By cutting down the usage of their vehicles, the are making a difference. People are and have been taking notice and began to join this movement. It has hada ripple effect and could really make a difference in our air pollution content if it keeps its momentum.\\n\\nThe second article, Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog, takes on a different setting. It takes place in Paris, France and whereas vaughn\\'s ban was voluntary, Paris\\'s not so much. The city had to take a drastic approach after they reached \"nearrecord pollution\" with smog so bad that is \"rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one the most polluted cities in the world.\" As you can imagine, precautions had to be taken. Those precautions resulted in a \"partial driving ban\". Those who did not listen to the band would be fined 22 euros. As a result, car traffic in the busy city of Paris was down a whole 60 percent. The ban was so effective that the smog cleared enough after a few days that the ban was retracted, showing proof that limiting car usage really does make a difference in our environment and should not be overlooked.\\n\\nI know that it is hard to imagine your world without having you vehicle to use at all times, but it is a change that needs to be made. Our air is suffering and getting worse and worse due to our increasing car usage. Citites are being made denser for two decades to make for better accessability. It has been proven that it works so why should we not give it a try? The citizens in our community should seriously consider this option of limiting our car usage. If they do, they will quickly be amazed with positive outcome that follows.Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit both individuals and the environment. As the passages suggest, there is a global movement towards separating suburban life from auto use, as part of a larger effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the quality of life in communities.\\n\\nFirstly, limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, and by decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can make a meaningful impact on reducing these harmful pollutants. For example, in Europe, cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can go up to 50 percent. By adopting car-free or low-car lifestyles, like in the German suburb of Vauban, we can make a positive change in the environment.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can improve air quality, especially in heavily polluted areas. Cities like Paris have implemented partial driving bans to combat smog and have seen congestion decrease and air quality improve. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, biking, and walking, we can reduce the amount of harmful pollutants released into the atmosphere, creating healthier and cleaner environments for ourselves and future generations.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and accessible communities. By designing suburbs with smart planning in mind, like placing stores within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation, we can create more compact and efficient communities. This not only reduces the reliance on cars but also promotes healthier and more active lifestyles. As seen in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people participate in a car-free day each year, car-free initiatives can generate a revolutionary change in how we view transportation and urban development.\\n\\nMoreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The reduction in the number of vehicles on the road can alleviate traffic congestion, leading to faster commute times and increased productivity. Additionally, by promoting alternative modes of transportation, individuals can save money on fuel and car maintenance costs. Instead of investing in personal vehicles, people can redirect their resources towards public transit systems and other means of transportation that benefit the entire community.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating sustainable communities, and providing economic benefits. As we move towards a more environmentally conscious and sustainable future, it is essential to prioritize alternative modes of transportation and promote car-free or low-car lifestyles. By doing so, we can create healthier, cleaner, and more accessible communities for everyone.What If i told you that instead of having the electoral college vote for us we can change the vote to popular vote. The American people and past presidents have all come to one conclusion, that the electoral college should be removed and instead move on to popular vote. Many people have had this thought but it has never became an actual reality and I personally believe that the electoral college should not decide our presidents.\\n\\nThe electoral college is a wide variety of people from different states who gather together and decide who becomes the president of the United States. The electoral college doesn decide who are president is, but they do so in a terrible manner such as they take the popular vote inot a miniscule amount of consideration and completely make up the decisions without taking inot consideration the american people who perfer popular vote over electoral vote. In 2000 the electoral college had something called the disaster factor where there was a giant election crisis. As stated in the article \" the system allows for much worse\" and that the american people should call them selves \"lucky\". The electoral college is a very risky way in order to elect our president What people dont realize is that each state gets a certain set of electoral votes and the three major states with the most electoral votes are California,Texas, and Florida. What most presidents do is cater to the states that have the most electoral votes which means all the other states with not as many electoral votes get excluded from giving their opinion as it is taken over by the bigger states. This is also awful because most states might vote for one president but get ruled out because the majority of electoral votes are taken over by the bigger states. Agriculture states such as Idaho might not get appealed as much by presidents and don\\'t get the supplies and support some states deserve. Even presidents such as Nixon, Bob Dole, and Jimmy Carter all belived that the electoral college should be abolished and move on to popular vote.\\n\\nAnother opposing view is that we should keep the electoral college for a couple of reasons to avoid run off elections but with popular vote that would almost never happen as people choose the candidate they perfer as run off election would be very unlikely. Another debate is that presidents would go after states with bigger populations but no matter what with electoral and popular vote presidents are always going to go after states with more people it\\'s a problem we can not avoid.\\n\\nI personally and storngly believe that we should abolish the electoral voting system and start using popular vote as it seems like our best chance to ever get the right president but even then we still make mistakes but us as the american people need to learn from our mistakes in order to make the future better for voting and many more things.Driving is a way of getting around quicker and to get to places you need to go, ever since the first car was massproduced it has caused a social drift where now in this generation almost all people use a car to get anywhere. Driving is fun and is a helpful way, but imagine if you had to lower the amount of time you would spend in you car, it wouldnt be the end of the world the only negative effect of not using your car is taking more time to get there and exercising. A car releases fumes into the air which cuases air pollution, driving is one big reasons why we have global warming. According to researchers people in CarFree communities feel less stress without their cars, because having a car is a responsibilitybuying gas, not dentingscratching the car, and ofcourse keeping it clean. Driving is everywhere and has been here for awhile, driving has also sadly played a role in deaths across the nation, Driving under influence, foolishness, accidents and so on and so fourth. Maybe less driving isn\\'t such a bad idea after all, there are already country that practice less car usage, even carfree days.\\n\\nWhen you have a car its a whole new world and responsiblitys you will have and you\\'ll have to maintain it, but driving is not the only way of getting around, there is running and bicycles and walking which are all healthy options, maybe next time we you need to go to the local store you can take a bike or run there yourself and save gas and lessen airpollution, ofcourse one trip without a car won\\'t save the world but its a start. This generation is closely tied to using cars and most of them don\\'t think that when they use a car the effects it has on using a car. Cars have been a great invention but now their starting to become a lifestyle. One of the common results of driving is traffic it is seen all over the place and takes up time and cuases stress among drivers, less driving would clear up the roads and lessen stress for others and be an open opportunity for others to get healthy.\\n\\nCars make up around 50% of greenhouse gas in the United States and cars are a nasty contributer to Global warming the fumes of the cars go in the air and get trapped there and hurt the ozone layer, also gasoline a source we find underground which we are using more and more than we get and it is a nonrenewable resource, we break down mountains just to find this resource. Oil has caused political disputes and the loss of forest,enviorments and more. When a car is destroyed it is sent to the scrapyard which is a big land just for destroyed cars and it takes up space, and it once could have been a nice forest. Car usage also is the producer of smog, sometimes smog is so bad in country they would have to ban carusage for a number of days that means we are abusing cars just a little too much.\\n\\nLastly, CarFree is not new or scaring it actually is a rising trend country have done CarFree day and the culture is spreading across the areas, being outside without a car using a bike or skateboard is a nice calm and relaxing way to spend a day and thousands of people seem to think so too, statistics say in the US the amount of cars being bought is slowly declining and driving less and the amount of licenses being optained is too. In some states there bike sharing programs and communities without cars. CarFree communties are a great way to save enviorment, lessen air pollution and to connect the community together instead of passing by taking a walk and or taking a bike ride with someone you would want to be with, and instead of hearing the constant sound of a motor engine hear the sound of children at play. Lessening carusage can save money, less stress, and make you view things in a different perspective or even CarPool so others don\\'t have to use their cars.Dear Senator PROPER_NAME, The purpose of this letter is to fight for the cause of removing the Electoral College and voting simply by popular vote. With evidence from \"What is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer, and \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,\" by Richard A. Ponser, I will elaborate on this subject. Now, since I am only fourteen, I do not claim to have all knowledge and be an expert on this method of voting, but it is not the way to choose our country\\'s leader.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is a compromise between who the people of America chose and who Congress has chosen. This is an incorrect method of selecting the President. The Constitution states that we the people have the choice to select our government not Congress. Yes, the constitutions founding fathers also established the Electoral College, but it is a thing of the past. As Richard A. Ponser writes, an \"anchorism\" In Defense of the Electoral College, par. 1, if you will. Moreover, the Electoral College does not belong in this day and age it is something that is outdated and in need of replacement.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also does not allow citizens to exercise their right to vote for their President, since Congress also has their say in the matter. The voting process was created for the citizens not the people who are in the government. In fact, Bradford Plumer states that \"over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" The Indefensible Electoral College, par. 1 This process of voting for President is undesired and despised my many people, by over half of the voters in America. The Office of the Federal Register writes that the Electoral College is \"a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens.\" Why does Congress have any sort of influence or say in this matter? The people choose their government not the governemt itself!\\n\\nAlright, the Electoral College is something that should not be used, by I can see the point of its purpose. The popular vote of the citizens can be infulenced by others, or advertisements and propoganda from political parties. Some voters are biased and overlook the negative things of the candidates because they do not wish to believe that this person does not support or believe everything they do. The Electoral College helps to balance that out. \"No region... has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" In Defense of the Electoral College, par. 5 Richard A. Ponser asserts this in his article, as well as the fact that no region or place has any reason to go about \"increasing his plurality\" par. 5 to make sure that a candidate will win. The Electoral College prevents this, resulting in a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and Congress.\\n\\nTo come to a conclusion, I have stated that the Electoral College is not a method that should be used to choose the President of the United States. It is outdated and does not allow citizens to choose the leader of their country. However, is balances out the popular vote and the Congress\\'s vote.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read this letter.\"All of our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\" Said David Goldberg. Nowadays Cars are our main Source when it comes to transportation.\\n\\nLimiting your car usage should absolutely be more important in todays society. It\\'s plenty of things going on around us that most are unaware about, And limiting your car usage can be one thing to start helping to prevent these issues. Most cars give off alot of Pollution in the cities you live in an that effects animals. For example: The oil spill was a major problem in the ocean and that killed alot of animals an Demolished most of the sea life environmental foodchains. The capital of France had an intensifying amount of smog, but car traffic tended to decreased 60% after 5 days. Beijing China was known as the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel Fuel was the blame. You could even try those cars that dont require gas so the cities could be less polluted, But theres disadvantages to those cars as well.\\n\\nAt one point of time gas prices were sky high and people weren\\'t really satisfied with it. Now Gas prices have decreased an people are even more satisfied an happy to get gas. Saving up on gas would help out alot to in todays world as well. How? Because Everything in life has a Big Fat Price tag on it so to help save up to get better things or things you need you can probably go for not paying for Gas as much. Everyday around 5:00 or 5:30 there\\'s something called 5:00 traffic. When everyone is just about getting off work, headed to night school, going to the store, or whatever the case may be. This is the craziest time of the day to drive an your just ready to get home an dont feel like dealing with traffic.... you can take the City bus, Subway, or maybe even walk if its not far. Some people may call you crazy but it reduces the amount of money being spent on gas. its only maybe like 10cents to ride the city bus i believe...But the point is your saving money. Then by the time you finally decide \"Oh i would like to drive my car\" your tank would be full cause you havent been driving it so you wouldnt have to stop for gas. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting \" Car Reduced\" Communities, and Legislators are starting to act. Many Experts expect public transportation to play a Larger Role in a new 6 year federal transportation bill approved this year, Said Mr. Goldberg. Walking isnt always quite bad. Look on the bright side your Burning Calories, shedding pounds, and if you run your building you Endurance. Instead of having to drive to a gym far away walk to a nearest one an have a pre workout by jogging or running there. Same thing applies to Bicycling.\\n\\nNowadays since majority of the United States own cars Traffic is horrible at certain hours of the day. Most people are too impatient for the wait or become aggressive drivers which is most likely to cause accidents. Maybe your ready to get home after a horrible day or your really tired from work an you realize your about to run into 5:00 Traffic an it\\'ll be forever until you finally get home. If taking the City Buses or subways you won\\'t have to deal with all that pressure. On a City bus you can just have a seat chit chat with other people as they hop on or just relax until you get to your destination. If your really tired you could just tell someone to wake you up when its time to. At least it\\'ll be better then you being behind the wheel. If your workplace is Walking or Bicycling distance then you should feel even better to just scroll past all the people having to deal with the traffic. \"Its a Good opportunity to take away stress and Lower Air pollution\" Said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat Bicycle with his wife.\\n\\nFellow Citizens should understand the Advantages of limiting their car usage because of the Pollution, To Save up on gas, and Less stress to deal with Traffic. Maybe one day cities would take more action an save up on gas for these reasons.Dear senator, My associates and I, have thought long and hard that we should have the Electoral College removed. Why? The Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and boring. We feel as if we should spice things up and be able to decide and presidents wit a majority vote rule. I know what your saying, \" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.\" With that I want to include that, if a state were to have it\\'s own vote within the state and turn that into a vote then use that as a majority rule everything would be much easier. For Instance, in florida if lets say 72% vote President Obama, then that would be a vote for obama from florida and with the other 49 states doing the same thing then we have a easy way of using the majority rule.\\n\\nBob Dole was right we should abolish the electoral college. Why should we vote for someone who half the time picks the president you dont want. There are many reasons why we should ban the electoral college we dont necessarily have use the majority rules method, but any other idea besides the electoral college i would go with any day. Why? Would you want to keep the electoral college? Why? Do you think this is helping america, its not really doing us harm, but why?\\n\\nI see you might argue that the electoral college is widely regarded an an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of deciding on a president. Is needs to be overruled by another method or even the majority rule. Considering you tried to i assume balance powers by making us vote for electors, who actually they get to vote for the president. You also might say their are five reasons you might want to keep the electoral college. The certainty of outcome, everyone\\'s president, swing states, big states, avoid runoff elections.\\n\\nAnd with all that said. I want just want you to think of other possibilities to use to replace Electoral College. I assure you that if the it is removed and you use the majority rule something similar you can decide a president much faster.Dear State Senator, The Electoral College is a process where voters select electors who then vote for the President of the United State. But is it really that reliable? Is it better than an election decided by that of popular vote.\\n\\nThe election process should be changed to one decided by popular vote instead of using the process of the Electoral College. First of all source two states that voters can sometimes get confused on the candidate that they actually voted for since they\\'re not directly voting for the President. Another flaw of the Electoral College also stated in source two is that \"... \"faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please....\" That is pure lying. That basically just made that voter vote for the candidate that they did not want. Another critical error is that in the process of the Electoral College is that not all states are equally represented. For example if there is a tie in the Electoral vote the election would be handed to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. This wouldnt be fair because since each state casts only one vote, then the single representative from Wyoming would only represent 500,000 voters. However the single representativee from California would represent 35 million voters. That hardly seems fair.\\n\\nWith Popular vote every American would get their say in a democratic way. As source three states \"... the Electoral College is not democratic in a modern sense. With popular vote everyone would be represented equally.\\n\\nI understand that \"the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote\" causes less chance of a dispute over the Electoral college than of the popular vote, but not everyone really gets a say. Also i understand that the Electoral College avoids run off elections but that is still very rare.\\n\\nState Senator it\\'s time to abolish the Electoral college, and switch to the use of popular vote for elections.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. Additionally, limiting car usage promotes the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, which can have several positive effects on physical and mental health.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to global warming, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can make a significant impact in combatting climate change and reducing our carbon footprint.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality. Cars contribute to air pollution through their emissions of pollutants like nitrogen oxide and particulate matter. These pollutants can have harmful effects on human health, leading to respiratory problems, cardiovascular issues, and other illnesses. By reducing car usage, we can reduce the amount of pollution in the air, leading to cleaner and healthier environments.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative modes of transportation. Walking, biking, and public transit are all more sustainable and eco-friendly options compared to driving. Encouraging people to use these alternative modes of transportation can have numerous benefits. Walking and biking are excellent forms of exercise and can help improve physical fitness. Public transit can also help reduce traffic congestion, making commutes faster and more efficient.\\n\\nMoreover, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. Traditional suburbs that rely heavily on car usage are often spread out, making it difficult to access essential services like grocery stores, schools, and healthcare facilities without a car. By adopting a model similar to the car-free community of Vauban in Germany, where amenities are within walking distance and public transportation is easily accessible, we can create more sustainable and efficient communities.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has various advantages for individuals and the environment. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, promotes alternative modes of transportation, and creates more compact and accessible communities. By embracing these advantages and adopting smart planning measures, we can work towards a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future.Dear senator, The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational as Bradford Plumber stated. First of all, The electoral college consists of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vise President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. We should abolish the electoral college because it is unfair to voters. It\\'s all because of the winnertakeall system that in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. They focus on the tight races in the \"swing\" states. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all 25 of the largest media markets didn\\'t get to see a single campaign ad.\\n\\nOne of the best arguments against the electoral college is the disaster factor. The state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960, segragationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. This means that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to him.\\n\\nAnother issue that most people worry about is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If that happens, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives and the Senate would choose Vise President.\\n\\nTo say the least, abolishing the electoral college is the best idea. According to a gallop poll in 2000, I am not alone. The gallop poll was taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. How does the electoral college even have any defenderes left? Even in a close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency.\\n\\nThe electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism and I couldn\\'t agree more. It is a thing from the past and should stay that way. The electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense because it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. Richard A. Posner even says that when you vote for a presidential candidate, you\\'re actually voting for a slate of electors.As stated in the article, the Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors, where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. A state\\'s entitled number of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional Delegation. There is one for each member in the House of Representatives, and two for every Senator. There are many reasons why the voting process should be changed to popular vote instead of the Electoral College. The two biggest reasons are as follows: Unfair elections and the freedom of the people.\\n\\nAs stated in the third source, the Electoral College is often considered an anachonism and is unliked across the nation. The reasons for which vary greatly from certainty of outcome to big states to swing states. Certainty of outcome means that one of the Presidential Candidates has to be chosen to become President. There are no recounts in Electoral College, whoever they like the most becomes President, and that ins\\'t fair to the people. Bigger states tend to have more members in the electoral college. This can greatly influence an election if a big state like Texas favors one candidate over the other. Swing states are the states that receive more attention than other states due to bias, greatly influencing votes. In my opinion, this is something that needs to be changed.\\n\\nCitizens of the United States of America are the ones who are supposed to decide who should be the President of the United States of America. It isn\\'t right to select a few people from each state to decide who the President will be. That power lies with the people, and nobody should be able to take that away. The votes of millions and millions of people are outweighed by the votes of a few hundred men and women. This is unjust and unfair in every way. If all the people in the United States wanted somebody as President, but the Electoral College disagreed, the Electoral College would win. Why should the Electoral College have more power than all of the people of the United States they shouldn\\'t. The power to decide who is President of the United States of America should always lie with the good citizens that live here.\\n\\nI hope that the voting process will change. I hope that it will finally become fair. That it will become what the people want it to be. It should be what the people want it to be. We the people of the United States have the power to change this, and we should work to change it. The voting process should no longer be the Electoral College but should be dicided by the people and only the people. The voting process needs to be fair and needs to be what the people want it to be.Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nIntroduction:\\nLimiting car usage is a growing trend in many parts of the world as cities and communities recognize the benefits of reducing dependency on cars. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on the ideas and information provided in the passages. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning, communities can improve their quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more accessible and sustainable environments.\\n\\nBody Paragraph 1: Improved Quality of Life\\nOne of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in the overall quality of life. The German suburb of Vauban serves as a prime example, where 70 percent of families do not own cars (Passage 2). Residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and more relaxed (Passage 3). By reducing traffic congestion and noise levels, communities that limit car usage create a more peaceful and quiet environment. Additionally, walking and biking become more common, leading to improved physical health and well-being.\\n\\nBody Paragraph 2: Environmental Benefits\\nLimiting car usage also has a significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. Passenger cars are responsible for a substantial portion of greenhouse gas emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to 50 percent in some areas of the United States (Passage 5). By decreasing reliance on cars, communities can help combat climate change and improve air quality, making them healthier and more sustainable for future generations. Paris enforced a partial driving ban during periods of high pollution, resulting in a significant drop in congestion and smog (Passage 14). Similar initiatives in Bogota, Colombia, have led to a car-free day, reducing traffic and promoting alternative transportation (Passage 21).\\n\\nBody Paragraph 3: Efficient Land Use and Accessibility\\nBy limiting car usage, communities can utilize their land more efficiently and create better accessibility. Vauban, for example, places stores within walking distance on the main street, reducing the need for malls along distant highways (Passage 6). This approach encourages people to walk or bike to nearby amenities, promoting a sense of community and reducing the need for excessive parking spaces. Additionally, this shift towards smart planning allows for the development of compact neighborhoods, making public transportation more accessible and reducing the dependence on private cars (Passage 6).\\n\\nConclusion:\\nLimiting car usage presents numerous advantages for communities. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning, cities and suburbs can improve their residents\\' quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more accessible and sustainable environments. With initiatives like car-free days and the promotion of public transportation, we can work towards a future where cars are no longer the linchpin of suburbs. It is essential for communities to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and prioritize the implementation of sustainable transportation solutions.Dear Senator, I firmly believe that we should keep the Electoral College. Many people say that it is \"outdated, irrational, and unfair\" but that is an option. Their are meany rational reasons about why the Electoral College is beneficial rather then destructive. Out of these many reasons i am able to narrow it down to 2 reasons about why the Electoral College should be kept. These reasons are Everyones President, and Swing States.\\n\\nIn Richard A. Posners\\' article about keeping the Electoral College he talks about the President that is elected being everyones this President. \"The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" This is not also a great example but it is a great counterclaim to Bradford Plumers article. In PLumers article he states that, \"candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the the tight races in the \"swing\" states. The Electoral College assures that the President isn just wanted in one area that is wanted all around the country. Electoral Colleges assure that the President is wanted in many differt parts of the United States.\\n\\n\"The electoral college invariably produces a clear winner,\" says Posner in his article. A way of producing a clear winner is by having swing states. Some people argue about the Electoral College turning off potential voters, Democrats in Texas but this may actually determine the election. If those other party people dont vote who knows mabey if they had voted their party might have been luckly. Statistics prove that when certaint parties win controversial states thats because some people from 1 party didnt vote. No voting especially in swing states can make your party, or your wanted candidate loose the election. Every year some of the swing states change so everyone should vote especially those in the swing states to insure your party or your candidate win.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is something that this country needs for our benefit. It helps us Americas get a President that will benefit us all not just those in certaint areas. Although some peopel dont think that the Electoral College is helping there are twice as many people who believe that just a popularity vote is a bad idea. Having swing states, and having a way that finds \"everyones\" president are just few of the many exaples about why we need the Electoral College.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in various parts of the world. This movement aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more sustainable communities. The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and increased physical activity.\\n\\nFirstly, limiting car usage can significantly improve air quality. According to a study mentioned in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the roads, we can decrease the amount of air pollution and consequently improve the health of both individuals and the environment. For example, the car-free day implemented in Bogota, Colombia, resulted in a significant reduction in traffic jams and smog.\\n\\nSecondly, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion. As more and more people own cars, roads become crowded and commuting times increase. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce the number of cars on the road and alleviate traffic congestion. Vauban, an experimental car-free community in Germany, is a prime example of how effective this approach can be. With only two places to park, the majority of residents do not own cars, resulting in less traffic and more peaceful streets.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can promote physical activity and lead to healthier lifestyles. When cars are the primary mode of transportation, people often lead sedentary lives, spending hours sitting behind the wheel. By encouraging walking and biking, we can incorporate physical activity into our daily routines. Not only does this lead to improved physical health, but it also has positive effects on mental well-being. In cities like Bogota, where car-free days are a regular occurrence, millions of people take the opportunity to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work, leaving the streets free of traffic jams and creating a healthier and more active city.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and increased physical activity. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and creating car-free communities, we can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions, create more sustainable cities, and improve the overall health and well-being of individuals and the environment. The examples mentioned in the passage set show that this movement is gaining momentum, both in developed and developing countries, and that it has the potential to create a long-term cultural shift away from car dependency.Turning 16 is one of the best times of your life because you get your license, your own new car and you dont have to rely on your parents to take you every where but, instead of getting a new car, why not get a brand new stylish bike? Millions and millions of people drive their car to provide them transportation to get to work, errands, school and little did they know much car usage really effects not only our planet but, ourselves too. Limiting car usage is a very effective way to eliminate stress, lower air pollution, reduce traffic, and save money to make the world a better and healthier place to live.\\n\\nTwo of the many advantages of limiting car usage is it eliminates stress and lowers air pollution. Being stressed is very unhealthy and a simple way to limit your stress is by limiting car usage. A media trainer named Heidrun Walter stated, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this waySource 1.\" If having a car is stressful, then ride a bike, or take a bus that still takes you from point A to B, just like a car does. Car usage is bad for our planet when it comes to air pollution. \"...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United StatesSource 1.\" Using other options besides taking a car would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Limiting car usage is a happier life and healthier living.\\n\\nSaving money and reducing traffic are other advantages of limiting car usage. Traffic is always a problem when trying to get where you need to go. \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the worldSource 2.\" There\\'s always so many people rushing to get to work in the morning and your car only moves a couple feet per minute from all the backed up traffic but, if there wasn\\'t so many cars on the road, that would never be an issue. Saving money is always an advantage especially in today\\'s economy, and all you have to do is limit your car usage. \"As of April 2013, the number of miles drive per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995Source 4.\" The reasoning behind that is because people \"could not afford new cars, and and the unemployed weren\\'t going to work anywaySource 4.\" Riding with a friend is always a way to save money and limit traffic too.\\n\\nCar usage is a big problem in today\\'s society. Eliminating stress, lowering air pollution, reducing traffic, and saving money are all advantages of limiting car usage that will lead our planet to a healthier and better living. When your parents surprise you with that pimped out bike instead of a car on your birthday, just remember all the beneficial reasons of limiting car usage and plus, you won\\'t have to pay car insurance.\"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" Heidrun Walter source 1. For many years, people have depended on cars to take them places and allow them to live a normal life. However, the recent decline in driving and car sales has proven that there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage would help reduce the greenhouse effect, would help reduce smog and other lowair pollution, as well as helping promote aspects of the eeconomy which differ from purely car sales and transportation.\\n\\nTo begin with, the greenhouse effect, a large part of which is caused by cars and their emissions, is endangering not only our environments and ecosystems, but also life as we know it. According to source 1 In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, passengers car are the cause of 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and also responsible for approximately 50% of emissions in certain parts of the US. Setting restrictions would allow for a decline in emission of greenhouse gases, which in turn would better life on Earth. Its effects could be seen all over the world, such as in global warming, rising oceans, etc. Therefore, limiting car usage would have a positive effect, because it would reduce the emission greenhouse gases.\\n\\nEqually important, the presence of smog, pollutioncaused fog, and lowair pollution is also endangering the wellbeing of humans and other species health, as well as the wellbeing of the Earth, so to speak. According to source 2 Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, \"After Days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" after setting restrictions for five days, Paris saw an improvement in air quality. We can thus infer that setting restrictions regularly would help reduce the pollution and general smog of the area. Placing restrictions would help promote various means of transportation, such as public transportation, bikes, walking, etc. An example would be the one from source 3 Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota in this case, a day during which a capital city places restrictions of the use of cars, helps build a campaign, which allows for bike paths, parks, and sport centers to be created and for sidewalks to be repaired. It has also led to restrictions to regulate rushhour traffic. Clearly, reducing and limiting car usage can not only reduce smog and lowair pollution, but can also help create a more active city.\\n\\nFinally, limiting car usage may promote different aspects of the eeconomy. According to source 1, the transportation bills in the US budget have, in the past, been used, for the most part, for highways. Reducing car usage may allow for certain parts of the US budget to be used for more important and diverse things, such as education, government funding, community life, and many more. Also, limitations on car usage could help conserve resources, allowing people to place their money into different aspects of their lives, like it is explained in source 4. Moreover, the less people can use their cars, the less people will buy cars source 4: \"Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license\". This will help people focus on rebuilding the economy. Obviously, there are economic advantages to limiting car usage, such as availability for flexibility in the government budget, conserving money, and the rebuilding of the eeconomy.\\n\\nTo conclude, there are various advantages to limiting car usage limitations may help improve the eeconomy, will help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, and will help reduce the lowair pollution and smog often found in largely populated areas.The Electoral College is a process that has been used in the United States Government for many years. It is the process that selects a candidate for Presidency based on electoral votes rather than the popular vote of the people. Many believe that the Electoral College should be abolished, but if we were to take it out of our governmental system, it would take away most of the effectiveness of our elections. The United States election process has worked very efficiently for many years with this process of election, it is very effective for choosing a candidate, and when it comes down to it, the last process of the Electoral College House of Representatives stepping in when there is a tie is very unbiased and is also effective in choosing a candidate. If we were to abolish the Electoral College, the United States government would basically be starting over with their election process, which isn\\'t necessarily a good idea once you are nearly 300 years into being an official country.\\n\\nThe United states election process has worked very effectively with the Electoral College for a large amount of years. There is no reason why it should be abolished from the country. Throughout all of these elections, the best candidate was chosen for each presidency in the end because of this great process of election. Rather than choosing the majority of the people, which could have a biased opinion, it is left up to both the citizens and a vote in Congress. This forms a balance between the two opinions. It is a very evenly based system, as said in Source 3 \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our deprived methods of choosing the President\", the article states that \"The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.\" This means that just by having one region of the United States really respect you and vote for you, this does not mean you are going to win the election. No region can get you the win. There simply are not enough electoral votes. Therefore, you must cover the most ground possible in the United States, because the more states you win over, the better your chances of becoming president are.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is a very efficient process of election. Instead of only the people voting and the decision of who becomes president left to the popular vote, the power of selection for presidency is evenly spread between Congress and the people. Some say that the electoral college is unfair, and that it is irrational. This is stated in the article \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer. He states \"The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.\" This means Plumer believes that those who argue in favor of the electoral collegee do not take a look at the reality of things when talking about this subject. The electoral collegee is very fair when it comes to the election of a president, because we all want to choose the best candidate for the job, and the only way to do that is to have an effective system for choosing a candidate without having a biased opinion tossed into the mix to mess up the process. It\\'s sort of like a job interview. You show what you have to offer to the boss in this case it is the whole country, and if you are chosen for the job that means you were the most qualified and that you are the best choice for the job. Whichever candidate gets chosen for the job was obviously the best candidate at the time, and there is nothing that anyone can do to change that.\\n\\nThe one situation that most people worry about within the electoral collegee is when there is a tie in the electoral vote. In this situation, the decision of the election would be placed into the hands of the House of Representatives and the Senate chooses the VicePresidential candidate best suited for the job. It does not matter how many representatives there are for any one state, as stated in the article \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer. He states that \"Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, representing 35 million voters.\" This means that no state has more power than another in this process, and every representative has the same amount of power when it comes down to chooosing a candidate best suited for being president. Additionally, it creates a sense of balance between all of the states and nobody has an unfair advantage when electing the next president.\\n\\nAs you can see, the electoral collegee is a very effective process used in the United States to choose a presidential candidate that should not be abolished from the country. With this system, the country has functioned very effectively for a very long time, the system is very effective for choosing a candidate best suited for the presidential position, and it is very unbiased and fair when it comes down to the decision of the House of Representatives for the election. Abolishing this efficient process would just do a disservice to the country\\'s election process, and I highly doubt that any wholehearted citizen of the United States of America would want to do that to his or her own home country.There are many advantages to limiting car usage. The majority of people that own a car have a lot of stress due to gas money and paying for the car. Owning a car is a serious expense. There are other types of transportation that can be useful for the people.\\n\\nAccording to Source 1, in Vauban, Germany 70 percent of the people that live there do not own a car, and 57 percent sold a car in order to move there. People were starting to realize that when they owned a car they would always be tense. After getting rid of the car, they have been much happier and less stressed.\\n\\nSince there are less cars in the streets of Germany, people have stopped and realized how beautiful everything was. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, is now relived as she walks the verdant streets where she can hear the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children.\\n\\nIn Paris, France due to the cold nights and warm days, the car emissions have been trapped by the warmer layer of air. Sometimes, weather can be the effect of something bad happening to your car. In the everyday world, people have been killed and have been in serious accidents. Not only because of the weather but also because of the lack of responsibility and concentration it takes to drive a vehicle.\\n\\nAs said in Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia many people do not drive cars. The majority of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work or wherever they need to go. The goal of this is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman, said \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" while he was riding his bicycle along with his wife next to him.\\n\\nAs people ride bike or hike or even just walk around their city, they can see and learn many new things just by being more aware of their surroundings. Cars have been in this world for a long period of time already. It\\'s time to take a break from the madness and start realizing how beautiful life is and how beautiful it can be by not destroying it with such a machine. Not only will there be less stress, but the world will be a lot more safer than it was.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing this letter to express my support for the Electoral College system in the election of the President of the United States. While there have been calls for its abolition in favor of a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves an essential purpose in our democracy. The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between a popular vote and a vote in Congress, and it continues to ensure a fair and balanced representation of state interests in presidential elections.\\n\\nOne of the primary advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome it provides. In the rare event of a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote, it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate\\'s share of electoral votes tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. For example, in the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes. The winner-take-all system in most states also ensures that even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must appeal to a broad range of voters across different states. This ensures that the president represents the interests of all regions of the country and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming successful in a national election.\\n\\nAnother benefit of the Electoral College is its ability to focus campaign efforts on swing states. This helps to ensure that candidates pay attention to the concerns and needs of voters in these states, as they become crucial in deciding the outcome of the election. Voters in swing states are more likely to be informed and thoughtful in their decision-making process, as they know that their votes will have a significant impact.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College gives weight to larger states in the political balance. Although states are apportioned by population in the Senate, the Electoral College provides a counterbalance to the larger states\\' influence in presidential elections. This prevents smaller states from being neglected by candidates, as the Electoral College gives them a proportionate number of electoral votes based on their population.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College system avoids the need for potentially complicated run-off elections. The winner-take-all nature of the Electoral College ensures that a majority winner is produced, avoiding the need for second-round elections. This streamlines the election process and provides a clear and decisive result.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democracy by ensuring that all states have a fair representation in the presidential election. It provides certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses efforts on swing states, balances the influence of larger states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While no system is perfect, the Electoral College has proven to be effective in maintaining a fair and balanced electoral process.\\n\\nI urge you to consider these points and support the preservation of the Electoral College system. It is a cornerstone of our democratic process and has served our nation well for over two centuries. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your continued dedication to upholding the values of our democracy.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and can greatly benefit our society. By reducing the reliance on cars, we can effectively tackle issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, smog, traffic congestion, and even promote a healthier and more active lifestyle.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major contributor to climate change. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can directly reduce the amount of harmful emissions being released into the atmosphere. This has implications not only for the environment but also for public health, as these emissions can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can help combat smog and air pollution. The passage about Paris\\'s ban on driving due to smog highlights the negative effects of car emissions on air quality. The smog in Paris rivaled that of heavily polluted cities like Beijing. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and create a healthier environment for everyone.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. The passage about Bogota\\'s car-free day demonstrates how millions of Colombians chose alternative transportation methods, such as biking, walking, and public transit, resulting in streets free of traffic jams. This not only improves the flow of traffic but also reduces travel times and increases efficiency. By promoting alternative transportation methods, we can alleviate the burden on our roads and make commuting more seamless and enjoyable.\\n\\nIn addition to the environmental and traffic benefits, limiting car usage can also promote a healthier lifestyle. The passage about Vauban, Germany, shows how residents who gave up their cars reported feeling happier and less stressed. By choosing to walk or bike instead of driving, individuals can incorporate physical activity into their daily routines, leading to improved health and well-being. This can also have positive effects on public health as a whole, as a more active population tends to have lower rates of obesity and chronic diseases.\\n\\nOverall, there are significant advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and traffic congestion, as well as promoting a healthier lifestyle, we can create more sustainable and livable communities. It is clear that the current efforts to separate suburban life from auto use, as seen in Vauban and other European cities, are a step in the right direction. As more people embrace these changes, we can build a future that is both environmentally conscious and people-centric.limiting car usage is an advantage for many reasons, for example, the pollution will become less of a problem, people will be less tense, and we will be devoid of traffic jams, which means less car accidents. To me cars are just something to get you to point A to B, but now that I have read these articles I realize that cars are alot worse for the environment then i thought, and that i should try using of ways of transportation.\\n\\nIn the passage it states \"After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" The pollution was out of control and for the most part it was because of the huge amount of car usage. The effect of banning car usage was resulting in an amazing outcome, less pollution, which is healthier for the community. The advantage of limiting car usage can effect a whole community and one way is less pollution. Bogota, Colombia had the same idea but they were not banning the car usage they have one day called the carfree day to show that its an advantage not to use cars all the time.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can even make you less tense, as said in the article,\" \"When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,\"said Heidrum Walter, a media trainerand mother of two, as she walker verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.\" Everything is better when car usage is limited it, makes you less tense and less pollution.\" \" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife.\" When there is less cars on the road there is less possiblity of car accidents or traffic jams.\"... leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.\" During the one day of no car usage, the streets were left of no traffic jams or accidents. The world is a better place with limited car usage. \" Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" To conclude, the limited car usage is a great way to reduce the amount of pollution, become less tense , and creat less possibility to have car accidents or road jams. After reading these article I have realized that taking othe transportations like bicycle or on foot could have huge impacts on the environment and my own well being.Every year, the residents of Bogota, Colombia celebrate a trending event known as CarFree Day. This skyrocketing campaign has led to as many as 7 million people giving up cars for the day, which reduces air pollution, promotes exercise, and avoids traffic jams. This may seem like a strange phenomenon, but reduced driving is spreading all around the globe. Just to name an example, there are multiple towns who have also caught on such as Vauban, Germany where only as many as 30 percent own cars.\\n\\nThere are multiple advantages to reducing cars from our lifestyles. A very large pro is how much we can reduce Greenhouse gasses. Not too long ago, there was a long span of nearrecord amounts of air pollution in Paris, France. In an attempt to fix this issue, they came up with a plan. The scheme was decided to order Evennumbered license plates to leave their cars behind for the day, or be fined 31 22 Euros. Oddnumbered cars would be told the same would apply for them the following day. Unfortunately, approximately four thousand people were fined, with twenty seven others having their cars impounded. just after five days, the smog was so thick that it rivaled one of the most polluted areas in the world Beijing, China. along with the weather, much of the smog was blamed by the massive amounts of diesel fuel that France uses. Many complained, but after accepting free public transit, and exceptions for hybrids and electric cars, the smog cleared enough for the French to take back the ban.\\n\\n\"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the united states,\" Claims Elisabeth Rosenthal, who wrote \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\". In response to some of these things, a recently finished city in Germany has completely carfree roads with a few exceptions. This is because of a few reasons. Firstly, Vauban, Germany doesn\\'t have any parking, driveways, or garages. the only place you can park is in either of the two large parking garages that you would buy a 40,000 parking space for, along with your home. This has resulted in seventy percent of the population of Vauban to be without cars, and about fifty seven selling theirs to move here. Suburbs like these have been trending all across Eurpope. In return, this has provied the community with less traffic, much less pollution, and the creation of denser cities so it\\'s better for walking to and from the shops and resturuants on mainstreet. According to Heidrun Walter, who is a mother of two, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" With more walking, and less sitting at the wheel, this can also provide more social interactions. Many people now ride bikes together to and from work, and there is less stress from traffic jams due to packed streets. This way, enviroments are more relaxed, open. Even for those who don\\'t give up driving completely, now carpool and travel in groups to reduce gas use and air pollution.\\n\\nThis trend has even begun to spread to the United states, the car capital of the world. Although the Vehicle\\'s immense popularity, the density of usage here has finally started to decline. Teens are getting their licenses later, and not even getting a car until much after. This is also a good thing for multiple reasons. There are less reckless teenagers roaming the streets, and much safer roads, along with the help of Carpooling, there is much less gas being used, and more excercise when people decide to ride their bikes or walk places.\\n\\nThere are numerous reasons we should reduce driving, Let it be reducing air pollution, promoting exercise, and avoiding traffic jams. even if we take small steps, we can create a much healthier lifestyle with just a small change.Dear State Senator, This letter of argument is to emphasize why we should not keep the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. There are very reasonable arguments for both claims as to if we should keep or abolish the Electoral College. Primarily, the Electoral College is the selection of electorss by popular vote to represent their supported party in the official presidential election. There is a total of 538 Electoral College electorss and it only takes the majority, 270 votes, to elect the president. It is not fair that the general population does not get an independent vote.\\n\\nIt is not the ordinary people who get to choose the president they want it is dependent upon which party the electors chooses. Voters don\\'t have control over who their electorss vote for. As said in the second article, Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000 against Bush however, Gore lost the electorsal vote resulting in the loss of the presidential election. In the past, there have been voters who refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and voted for whomever. There is also the concern of a tie in the electorsal vote.\\n\\nIf that were to happen then there would certainly be no chance that the popular vote would have an impact on the selection of the president because it would now be in the hands of the House of Representatives. The Electoral College is unfair to voters they do not get the final choice as to where their vote goes. They are not voting for the presidential candidate they want. The voters are voting for a slate of electorss. However, there are some benefits to having an Electoral College such as larger states getting more attention from presidential candidates than smaller states and it also avoids RunOff elections which is when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes.\\n\\nState Senator, please realize that this is not fair or justifiable. There may be an upside to the Electoral College, however, it is in my strongest opinion based on factual content that this is not a fair method and it should be abolished. Being empathetic for the ordinary voters of the United States would provide clarity for your opinion on the situation. Imagine if you were a general voter who did not get an official vote in the presidential election you would feel cheated also. This is why I ask you to strongly consider these legitimate words.Title: The Benefits of Limiting Car Usage: Lessons from Vauban, Paris, Bogota and Beyond \\n\\nAcross the globe, from American suburbs to bustling European cities and beyond, a cultural shift is underfoot – the reduction and adaptation of car usage. This essay explores the advantages born from these shifts, supported by evidence from Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States.\\n\\nVauban, Germany offers a highly progressive exemplar of the advantages of reducing car dependency thanks to its quasi \\'car-free\\' suburban model. As per Rosenthal\\'s report, 70% of Vauban residents do not own cars, which mitigates environmental costs immensely (Rosenthal, Paras 1-4). This reduction succors a 12% decrease in greenhouse emissions, thus making an impactful stride towards reducing global warming (Rosenthal, Para 5). \\n\\nFurthermore, by separating suburban life from auto use, living standards are improved. This is exemplified by Vauban resident Heidrun Walter, who stated her quality of life improved after forgoing her automobile (Rosenthal, Para 3). Alternatively, overemphasis on car usage was evident in Paris\\'s near-record pollution that instigated a partial driving ban (Duffer, Para 10). Therefore, car reduction not only benefits the environment but also the quality of public life. \\n\\nThe advantages of reducing car usage are also reflected in Bogota\\'s annual car-free day. Celebrated for fostering alternative transportation, this initiative simultaneously improved air quality and reduced stress among participants (Selsky, Paras 21, 24). This suggests that reducing car usage can potentially promote both environmental and public health.\\n\\nStudying these initiatives from different parts of the world, the transition towards reduced car usage seems not only beneficial but practical and achievable. Emerging patterns in the United States suggest a burgeoning shift in attitudes towards car ownership and driving (Rosenthal, Paras 29-33). The rise of alternative commuting arrangements, carpooling apps, car-sharing programs, and new transportation policies reflect these changing priorities (Rosenthal, Paras 36-37). \\n\\nDemographically, less interest in driving amongst younger generations further substantiates this trend. A notable decrease in car usage amongst youth suggests potential for an accelerated shift in the future (Rosenthal, Paras 38, 41). \\n\\nVauban, Bogota, Paris, and other global cities are vivid illustrations of the environmental, societal, and individual benefits of limiting car usage. As these examples indicate, car dependency is not necessarily synonymous with accessibility and convenience. With conscious effort towards cultural and infrastructural changes, as seen in Vauban\\'s smart planning, Paris\\'s legislation, or Bogota\\'s car-free day, a transition towards reduced car usage is both feasible and advantageous. Embarking on this transition appears to be an essential responsibility to both present and future generations, the environment, and our quality of life. With the growing commitment to sustainable living, our societies can adapt to a less car-dependent lifestyle and shape a beneficial model of life for future generations.\\nDear Senator,\\n\\nI hope this communication finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to a notable concern: the maintenance or abolition of the Electoral College system of electing the President of the United States.\\n\\nThe Electoral College, as detailed by the Office of the Federal Register, is a process established by the Founding Fathers to balance the election of the President by the vote of Congress and the direct vote of citizens. This procedure guarantees each state\\'s representation in the electoral process through a bipartisan group of electors who ultimately cast votes on behalf of their state\\'s majority-backed candidate.\\n\\nHowever, critics such as Bradford Plumer argue that the system is flawed, outdated, and undermines democratic integrity by depriving citizens of a direct say in the Presidential election. Recent cases where a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the electoral vote, as occurred in 2000, demonstrate this discrepancy.\\n\\nDespite these valid arguments, there is a compelling defense for the Electoral College as presented by Judge Richard A. Posner. The five reasons he presents include the certainty of outcome, inducing a candidate to pursue trans-regional appeal, motivating attention to swing states, balancing the influence of large states, and averting complicated run-off elections. \\n\\nEach side has substantial arguments that merit serious consideration. However, I am leaning towards the perspective of retaining the Electoral College. Despite its imperfections, the system fosters a broad consensus that encourages pan-national appeal, preventing a few populous regions from determining the election outcome.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College provides certainty of the outcome. Disputes over results are infrequent under this system since a winner-take-all method in most states ensures a decisive victory.\\n\\nI understand many contemplate abolishing the Electoral College due to its perceived undemocratic methodology. However, we must also respect the wisdom of our forefathers in creating a balanced, representational system that considers diverse interests across all states.\\n\\nI urge you to consider advocating for reforms that improve the Electoral College, making it more transparent and less vulnerable to potential manipulations, thereby enhancing its democratic credibility rather than seeking its total abolition.\\n\\nI appreciate your service to our state and thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your Name]Title: The Unseen Benefits of Limiting Car Usage \\n\\nAn intelligent shift in our societal perspective on vehicle utilization is a necessary step in creating a healthier, more sustainable environment. Limiting car usage offers copious advantages that go beyond addressing the urgent issue of global climate change. The implementation of car-free zones in cities like Vauban, Germany, and the establishment of car-free days in Bogota, Colombia, spotlight the potential of alternatives to the prevalent car culture currently dominating urban landscapes worldwide.\\n\\nA conscious effort to reduce car usage not only minimizes greenhouse gas emissions, hence curbing climate change efforts, but it also promotes healthier lifestyles and fosters a more communal living atmosphere. The transformative experiment in Vauban has proved car-free suburban life to be both practical and beneficial. With limited parking areas and a pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, Vauban\\'s initiative has resulted in 70 percent of families forgoing ownership of vehicles and enjoying decreased stress levels (Rosenthal). The echo of bicycle wheels and lively, untroubled children replacing roaring engines and honking horns is testimony to the drastically improved quality of life in this suburban enclave. \\n\\nFurthermore, the adoption of public transport in place of private vehicles can reduce air pollution exponentially. Paris\\'s temporary driving ban due to hazardous pollution levels is a stern reminder of the environmental implications of our over-dependence on automobiles (Duffer). Transportation companies, recognizing this, are rebranding themselves as “mobility” companies with a wider product range that accommodates alternatives such as public transit, car sharing initiatives, and cycling (Rosenthal).\\n\\nCities around the globe, like Bogota, taking up the challenge of hosting car-free days, provide us with tangible evidence of the feasible and beneficial alternatives to our car-centric lifestyle. The event, initiated to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, witnessed a positive response despite inclement weather conditions (Selsky). This initiative complements the ongoing efforts to restructure our built environment to be more accommodating of pedestrian and bicycle movement, including the construction of larger sidewalks and bicycle paths.\\n\\nLimiting car usage also encourages a shift in our cultural perception of cars from a symbol of freedom and status to just another mode of transportation. With the rise of car-pooling apps and public transit, the younger generations are gradually distancing themselves from the conventional idea of car ownership and driving, favoring public transport, walking, or cycling. The decreasing interest of the millennials in car ownership represents a potential cultural shift, which holds promises for a more sustainable future for our cities (Rosenthal).\\n\\nIn conclusion, the advantages of limiting car use are far and wide. It promises cleaner air, healthier lifestyles, more vibrant communities, and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. With careful planning and implementation, the transition from a car-dependent society to a more sustainable, car-free one is not only possible but also beneficial in so many ways. Changing our attitude towards automobiles, embracing public transportation, and encouraging walking or cycling as means for short-distance commuting, could herald an era which distances itself from the harmful effects of car culture.The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly apparent in today\\'s society. Not only does it contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but it also promotes healthier lifestyles and more efficient use of resources. Several examples from around the world demonstrate the positive impact of reducing car dependency.\\n\\nOne such example is Vauban, a car-free district in Germany. In this community, residents are not allowed to have street parking, driveways, or home garages, except for a few designated areas. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of them sold their cars to move there. The residents have noticed a significant improvement in their quality of life, with less stress and a greater sense of happiness. This suggests that reducing car usage can have positive effects on mental health and overall well-being.\\n\\nSimilar initiatives can be seen in other parts of the world, including Paris and Bogota. In response to high levels of pollution, Paris implemented a partial driving ban, where motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home on certain days. This led to a significant reduction in congestion and smog in the city, providing evidence that limiting car usage can have immediate and tangible benefits for the environment and public health.\\n\\nIn Bogota, Colombia, a program called Car-Free Day has been implemented for several years. On this day, millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work, leaving the streets free of traffic jams. This initiative not only reduces pollution and congestion but also promotes alternative modes of transportation and healthier lifestyles. It has been so successful that other cities in Colombia have joined in, and municipal authorities from other countries have come to observe and learn from the event.\\n\\nFurthermore, studies have shown that Americans are driving less and purchasing fewer cars. This shift in behavior can be attributed to various factors, including the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of city centers, and the availability of alternative transportation options such as bike-sharing and car-sharing programs. This decrease in car ownership and driving not only benefits the environment but also has potential implications for the car industry, as companies are starting to rebrand themselves as mobility companies with a broader range of products and services.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various aspects of society. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to promoting healthier lifestyles and more efficient use of resources, limiting car usage has a positive impact on both individuals and the environment. Initiatives such as car-free districts, driving bans, and programs like Car-Free Day are tangible examples of the benefits that can be achieved through reducing car dependency. By embracing these initiatives and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.People all over the United States, even the world, drive their cars to get to where they need to go work, school, the mall its a normal thing. But, the increasing number of greenhouse gas emissions are not normal. Imagine our world crumbling down, our air supply at its alltime minimum, the exuding amout of smog forming around us, our families and friends too ill to breath all because of cars. Along with many advantages, there should be a limit of car usage worldwide.\\n\\nIn the article paris bans driving due to smog, it explains the drastic change in smog formation, leading Paris officials to temporarily ban driving. Though a small percentage citizens citywide ignored the ban, the pollution was lessened enough to end the law after a day. Adding on in a different source written by Andrew Selsky, Bogota started the revolution of a carfree day once a year which promotes \"alternative transportation and reducing smog\". The productivity of this event has caused other countries to do the same, lessen vehicle usage.\\n\\nAlthough there are a small number of cities and countries that have reduced their car usage, people can not hold the reliance on those multiple thousands of responsible citizens. Said in the End of Car Culture\\' by Elisabeth Rosenthal, \"... Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.\" and that is without putting an effort like Vurban. Vurban is a small city in Germany that has little to no cars. Stores are purposely placed on a walkway or a main street which eliminates the excruciatingly long car rides needed to get to a specific place. Because of telecommunication, sociologists believe that sooner or later people of America will take initiative and there will be no more vehicles, that the internet will be our form of connection. Therefore, eliminating the threat of greenhouse gasses.\\n\\nDuring times of panic and frustration one is tempted to blame. If the beautifully lush world we live in goes crashing down, we all are the ones to blame. We, the ones who use our productivity wisley, will know we did our part limit the usage of cars.Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage for a Smarter Future\\n\\nIntroduction:\\nThe issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, specifically from vehicles, has become a pressing concern for both developed and developing nations. As a result, initiatives such as car-free neighborhoods, driving bans, and car-free days have been introduced to limit car usage. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on evidence from multiple sources, highlighting the benefits to the environment, public health, and quality of life.\\n\\nBody Paragraphs:\\n1. Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions: \\nCar emissions account for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, a leading cause of climate change. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal\\'s New York Times article, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change.\\n\\n2. Improved air quality and public health:\\nDriving bans, such as the one implemented in Paris due to smog, not only help combat pollution but also improve air quality. In Robert Duffer\\'s article from the Chicago Tribune, congestion in Paris decreased by 60 percent after a five-day driving ban, bringing the city\\'s air pollution levels down. This improvement in air quality leads to a decrease in respiratory problems and other health issues caused by pollution, benefiting the overall well-being of citizens.\\n\\n3. Enhanced accessibility and livability:\\nSmart planning, as highlighted in Elisabeth Rosenthal\\'s article, seeks to separate suburban life from excessive car usage. Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, serves as an example of how limiting car usage can lead to a more accessible and livable neighborhood. With stores located within walking distance and public transportation easily accessible, residents can lead more sustainable lives without the need for personal vehicles. This concept is being adopted worldwide, creating compact and accessible suburbs that prioritize public transportation over cars.\\n\\n4. Economical and efficient transportation:\\nBy limiting car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, communities can reduce the burden on infrastructure. Instead of investing in extensive road networks and parking spaces, resources can be diverted to improve public transportation systems. Car-free communities can also promote efficient car-sharing programs, reducing the need for individuals to own cars and saving them money on maintenance and other associated costs.\\n\\n5. Changing cultural norms:\\nAs mentioned in Elisabeth Rosenthal\\'s article, studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This shift in behavior not only contributes to reduced emissions but also indicates a cultural change in our perception of personal vehicles. Younger generations are less concerned about car ownership and prioritize alternative transportation options. This change in attitude presents an opportunity to reshape our cities and prioritize sustainable modes of transportation.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and far-reaching, benefiting the environment, public health, and the livability of communities. By adopting smart planning principles and encouraging alternative modes of transport, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, enhance accessibility, and promote sustainable transportation practices. Implementing these changes now can help secure a smarter and more sustainable future for all.The elector college is a controversial subject today in america, based on many questionable policies that leave many americans confused and cheated. This is why I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states.\\n\\nWith the electoral college way of electing a president voters arent actually voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors who will then vote for the candidate. There are so many things that can go wrong when electing like this. Voters can\\'t necessarily control who their electors vote for, you may vote for a certain slate of electors but they may still go ahead and vote for someone else. Sometimes voters get confused and may vote for a slate of electors who are for the wrong candidate. For example, in 1960 segragationists in the Louisiana Legislature almost succeded in replacing the democratic electors with new ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, so a popular vote for Kennedy would not actually go to him. Although these things dont happen all time their is always the possibility and why take that chance on such an important event, choosing our president the person who will lead our country.\\n\\nIn an election their really is a process of voting and voting again. Instead of couting the number of people who want a certain president and so on. We are viewed as a state and some states having more say than other even if the votes are in the same margin. This is the reason why some states are focused on more by the candidates and are heavily educated on the topic and given more attention than smaller states whose votes wont change much. an even bigger problem is te fact that most states operate on a winnertakeall basis so even a slight majority vote one way will give that person all of the votes. A very worrying prospect as expressed in source two is the possibility of a tie. in which the election would be given to the house of representatives. Each state only gets on vote so a representative representing 500,000 people would have as much say as representatives representing 35 million people. Why not just cut out all of the extra processes and focuses on the decision of the people directly.\\n\\nAlthough there are many arguments against the electoral college there still are people who argue in favor of it. There is a certainty of outcome with this process. There will less likely be a run off election with this process. All in all the major arguments against this process outweigh the pros of it, which are few.\\n\\nWith all of the reasons to go against this process I think it is necessary to change the election to popular vote for the president. We need to give the voice directly back to the people of our country so we know that we really do choose our fate in these elections.Dear Senator of Florida, Though longstanding and \"fair\" to both citizens and Congress, the Electoral College is completely unnecessary and faulty. Election by popular vote is much more practical and leaves room for less errors. First off, the Electoral College warps the perception of voting, for when citizens vote, it is not directly for the president. Also, the Electoral College leaves many loopholes, which cause many issues and disputes.\\n\\nTo start off, the Electoral College does not allow citizens to vote directly, like a true democracy. This is unfair, unjust, outdated, and irrational. The natural right of a citizen should be to directly vote for something of a passionate matter. Controversies are everywhere, and citizens should be able to have a direct say in what is done. In What Is the Electoral College?, the Office of the Federal Register declares, \"You help choose your state\\'s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate\\'s electors\" 1.6. This seems quite indirect and faulty. Can the electors be trusted? We do not know and we definitely do not want to find out. In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford Plumer says, \"...according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now\" 2.9.\\n\\nMoving on, the Electoral College also contains many loopholes in the system. It is very possible to have issues arise. Electors can become faithless, the number of electors for a certain state can be controversial, and legislatures can \"defy the will of the people.\" In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford Plumer says, \"Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John. F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy\" 2.11. This unfortunate fact really shows how faulty the electoral college system really is. Do we really want so many loopholes when it comes to choosing the person who will run our country?\\n\\nOne may say that the electoral college has less disputes than that of just the popular vote. In In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president , Richard A. Posner says, \"A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it\\'s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote\" 3.18. However, this is untrue in my opinion. The Electoral College has already created so much controversy and dissension, along with faults and problems. For the wellbeing of our country, it would be best to simply get rid of the Electoral College alltogether.\\n\\nOverall, the Electoral College should not exist choosing the president should rely on simply the popular vote. The Electoral College is not a direct way for citizens to vote, which shows signs of America not being a true democracy. Also, the Electoral College has many loopholes that are sources of dispute and issues in America. To sum it up, this method of choosing the president, is irrational, unfair, unjust, and outdated. The Electoral College should be abolished.As of April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was down 9 percent. So that means people are starting not to drive as much, which is not a bad thing. Actually they\\'re many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can actually help the environment, help the emissions, and if we do limit car usage it can make cities denser as well as having some places that don\\'t use cars. Which will be good for the world.\\n\\nTransportation is really big in America. People drive all the time, were a moving country. So driving and using cars does effect our environment. One big thing going on is smog. One country that i can point out is Paris. Paris had so much smog that they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city. \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...\" according to the article Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer. Paris has more smog than other european capitals. Which is really bad because that can effect us as humans. In Bogota They are doing a program that involves banning cars for a day. The goal was to promote transportation and reduce smog which it did. So limiting car usage can improve safety and make the environment more clean.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can also have beneficial implications for carbon emissions. If we created cities with pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, it can lower emissions and if the emissions are in good care then the environment will be to, \"since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants.\" President Obama has goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions. Experts say\" Is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe...\" according to the article In German suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, by Elisabeth Rosenthal she says\" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United states. So thats pretty bad so if we limit car usage we can help fix that and maybe even have a lower percentage on emissions.\\n\\nVauban home to 5,500 residents are really taking limitation to cars serious. They may be the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life. But they are doing really good. Other countries around the world are adopting what they are doing in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible, which is a good thing. Espescially for people that dont use cars, and especially if your trying to make the air more cleaner. According to In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, \"Vauban, copleted in 2006 is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called \" Smart planing\".\" This is a advantage for the world because we need to have someplaces that actually dont use cars. Also Vauban can inspire other countries to do the same. Which will be a advantage.\\n\\nSo they\\'re are many advantages for limiting car usage. A lot has to do with the environment like it reduces smog and helps emissions which will be better for the world. The biggest advantage for limitation on car usage is pretty much a better world and who wouldnt want to live in a better world. It can also help other places be like Vauban. They don\\'t use cars as much and it works for them, and a lot of people should start doing that. These advantages will really help the world if we do decide to ever limit car usage.When were voting for president were not technically voting for the president in fact we are voting for the slate of electors. The electors can be anyone without a public holding office. Electoral college process is not a good process for presidency. While a president can get the majority of the popular vote on the other hand, he could have the minority of the electoral college votes. That president would lose the election even though he technically had the most votes. We should change the process into popular votes for the president.\\n\\nThe electoral college can or will defy the will of the people. The article \"The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted ,Back in 1960,segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose Jhon F. Kennedy.So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.The election whould have gone the other way if the due to the electoral college. The electoral college are way too risky to take on. just simply couple of unwilling electors can change the tide of the election.\\n\\nThe electoral college is a unfair process because of the winnertakeall system. In the article called What Is The Electoral College\", by the office of the federal register it quoted most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. In the other article \"The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted , candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. Electoral college is a unfair process because of the winner take it all. The winner takes it all system is a unfair process for the American citizens. even with a slightly change in the electoral college could change the tide or even cause a tie in the election.\\n\\nIn conclusion,The electoral college is a unfair process that has cause presidential election to change. The best results for electing president is by the popular vote. Obviously popular votes sounds more efficient and a clean election. The winnertakes it all process counterfits the number of american citizens voting result. Eletoral college process is an extra step to the election with more problems than barely any benefits. Electoral college should be change and alter in to a different process with clean votes that\\'ll actually be fair for once.Dear Florida senator, I\\'m a young student, and no I don\\'t haye much of a background in political ideas or things, but I know we should keep the Electoral College. This old process was created to make electing a President easier and faster, which I belieye it does.\\n\\nNow, the Electoral College has 538 electors, but a majority of 270 electoral yotes is required to elect the President. Some will argue that we aren\\'t yoting for a President but we\\'re yoting for the people, or electors, behind them. I would say that they aren\\'t wrong, but we aren\\'t just yoting for those electors, we are yoting for the whole idea behind their campaigning. We don\\'t yote for the person, we yote for the idea that person agrees to carry out. By haying this process, we can focus on getting swing states yotes. The yotes of these states matter the most, in my opinion, because they are likely to swing at any minute. As said in \" In Defense of the Electoral College: Fiye reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President \", \"swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that the are going to decide the election.\" This helps ayoid runon elections because the small states are likey to just yote for the most popular President, knowing their yote won\\'t really make a difference.\\n\\nMost states haye a \"winnertakeall\" system that giyes all of the electors to the winning candidate. Howeyer, there are a few states that haye yariation with the \"proportional representation\" idea. The \"winnertakeall\" system actually works really well. Other parts of the Electoral College has it\\'s problems but not this one. With this process it makes it easy to giye all of the yotes to one person, this means all of the state will be on the same page and not fighting with itself. This process y. proportional representation, is better in my opinion because it\\'s quicker and helps make the presidential process one step easier.\\n\\nAnd lastly, it\\'s a tradition to use the Electoral College. The pedigree for this process was created a really long time ago by some of the most outstanding leaders in our country. The article \" What Is the Electoral College?\\n\\n\" states that, \"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a yote in Congress and election of the President by a popular yote of qualified citizens.\" The process we created as the United States, has its up and downs but it is one of the longest standing traditions we haye. Hopefully you take my letter in to consideration. Thank you for reading.Many people now a days use cars, trucks, buses or other ways of transportation on a daily baises. Most do not even think twice about all of the pollution they are creating in our world, or even the traffic that they are helping create. Fellow citizens should start becoming aware of this problem and finding different ways to travel.\\n\\nMany people who work in larger cities tend to face many traffic problems when on their way to work, sometimes causing them to be late for their job. If we were to begin doing things like carpooling, walking, biking, or even just taking a bus to work or school we could immediately see changes in the amount of traffic. In Paris, after reaching several days of nearrecord pollution, they ordered a partial driving ban in attempt to clear up the city. According to source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France...\" in just five short days. Other places, such as Bogota, Columbia are also taking part in carfree days. These places are also seeing a drastic decline in the amount of traffic seen in the city. The author of source 3: Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.\\n\\nAnother advantage to limiting car usage will be that there will be a noticeable decline in the amount of smog and pollution. \"Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals\" as stated in source 2:Paris bans driving due to smog. After being ordered a carfree day, smog was cleared enough by the following Monday for them to call off the ban on cars the next day. One simple step such as a weeklong carban can reduce the amount of pollution drastically. Elisabeth Rosenthal states in paragraph 8 that \"an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.\" If we begin to limit our car use, we will notice great changes in our environment.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if we do just a few simple things in our society, we will be able to notice the great advantages to limiting car usage. The amounts of traffic in cities will decrease, as well as the amount of pollution in our city, all because of just a few simple things that we can change.Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage – A Case for Sustainable Urban Living\\n\\nThe unprecedented growth in the usage of cars, spurred by the allure of convenience and flexibility, has contributed significantly to environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. As such, urban planners and environmentalists are increasingly advocating for a paradigm shift towards limiting car usage in favor of sustainable transportation alternatives. The experience in Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the changing car culture, especially amongst younger generations in the United States, provides a compelling case for this transition.\\n\\nVauban, a suburb in Germany, serves as a pioneering model of a car-free society. By eliminating the ability for most residents to park their cars nearby, the majority of the population has given up car ownership, living happier and less stressful lives (Rosenthal, Passage 1). This paradigm shift towards a car-free lifestyle has not only eliminated the car-related greenhouse gas emissions significantly but also created a peaceful and environmentally friendly atmosphere that promotes health and wellbeing.\\n\\nIn Paris, a partial ban on car usage due to elevated pollution levels produced positive results with congestion dropping by 60% and air pollution levels decreased substantially (Duffer, Passage 2). This impressive result underscores the tremendous potential of limiting car usage in alleviating the public health and environmental crises looming over urban areas globally.\\n\\nColombian cities have also experienced the benefits of limiting car usage through the \\'Day Without Cars\\' initiative. This event saw considerable public participation, leading to less air pollution and stress, thus enhancing the overall quality of life (Selsky, Passage 3). It also doubled as a platform to promote alternative modes of transport, such as biking, that are more environmentally friendly.\\n\\nIn America, there is a noticeable cultural shift as people buy fewer cars and opt for alternative modes of transport. Researchers argue that this trend could significantly reduce carbon emissions since transportation is the second-largest source of America\\'s greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, Passage 4). Moreover, increased internet connectivity and telecommuting potential, the rise of carpool apps, and city center renewal are changing the face of transport. The demographic changes, particularly amongst the younger generation, further reinforce this shift.\\n\\nIt becomes apparent that limiting car usage has tangible advantages. These include a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, alleviated traffic congestions, and enhanced overall quality of life. However, to fully realize these benefits, deliberate planning for public transportation systems and alternative mobility options needs to be considered. It is also crucial to communicate these benefits to the public to foster widespread adoption and facilitate this instrumental transition towards sustainable living.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[State Senator\\'s Name]\\n[State Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: Support for the Electoral College\\n\\nDear [State Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to continue to uphold this system for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue for a switch to a popular vote system, I believe there are significant advantages to keeping the Electoral College intact.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. This system minimizes the possibility of disputes over the election results, as the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College would typically exceed their share of the popular vote. This was evident in the 2012 election when President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. In addition, the winner-take-all nature of most states\\' allocation of electoral votes leads to landslide victories, reducing the possibility of a tied electoral vote.\\n\\nAnother compelling reason to maintain the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions of the country. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, meaning that candidates must have trans-regional appeal in order to win. This is crucial for a successful presidency, as it ensures that all residents, regardless of their region, feel that their voices are heard and that the President will consider their interests.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, which increases engagement and attention from voters. In a winner-take-all system, candidates focus on toss-up states, leading to more thoughtful and well-informed voters who make crucial decisions for the nation as a whole. This focus on swing states ensures that candidates address the concerns and needs of a diverse range of voters, rather than solely catering to regions that are already in their favor.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College restores balance to the political influence of large states. While the Constitution\\'s mal-apportionment of the Senate may result in a loss of weight for large states, the Electoral College provides them with a mechanism to regain some political significance. This is exemplified by the fact that a close popular vote in a large state like Florida can result in 29 electoral votes, whereas the same margin of victory in a smaller state like Wyoming would only yield 3 electoral votes. By giving large states more attention during the campaign process, the Electoral College ensures a fair representation of their interests.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, preventing complications and uncertainties that arise when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. Instead, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, avoiding the need to prolong the election process with additional rounds of voting.\\n\\nWhile critics argue that the Electoral College discourages potential voters in non-competitive states, it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains significant despite knowing that their vote may not swing the outcome on a national level. Voters participate in elections to express their political preference, and their engagement is driven by their desire to have their stance represented, rather than the belief that a single vote may decide the entire election.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty, ensures trans-regional representation, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the political influence of large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While a popular vote system may seem appealing at first glance, the Electoral College has proven to be effective in ensuring fair and balanced presidential elections throughout history. I urge you to maintain and defend this essential democratic process for the benefit of our great nation.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration. I greatly appreciate your dedication to serving our state and country.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Cars our main source for travel, what we depend on. But consider how things were before cars, and can going back to those times make a positive impact? How can limiting car usage be advantageous to people, the environment, and just everything in general?\\n\\nIn German Suberb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a city has already adapted to the idea of a car free, or a noncar dependant city. They did so by having \"only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home.\" This limit of parking space can cause drivers to just stop trying to drive, because why bother if there is limited to no places to put the car? This change allows for people to be less stressed, and when one doesn\\'t have a car, there\\'s less of a rush to get somewhere because the ability to rush is gone. There\\'s also the need of less pollution that causes car usage to go down. \"And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe.... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.\" The above quote by Elisabeth Rosenthal proves that something must be done to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing car usage can do so. Vauban finds is useful, why doesn\\'t everyone?\\n\\nParis bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, cars were slowly banned in order to clear the air, sort of like when one puts their body through a detox. When that ended up helping, more cars were banned, and this led to the realization that cars were bad, more or less. The environment needs less cars, which means we need to be less dependant on cars for everything, because soon this so called need for cars is going to leave us gasping for breath, and that is not a good thing. \"Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has... tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.\" The usage of diesel, which is ultimately the usage of cars, is leading to a \"blanket\" of air trapping the car emissions, causing pollution. The pollution is so dangerous to have just sitting there, waiting to be breathed in and choked on. After realizing that the ban of cars has been helpful for the environment, shouldn\\'t everyone else realize it is advantageous too?\\n\\nThe sooner the human race stops depending on cars, the sooner the human race will be able to breath and think carefully and safely again. Everyone is aware pollution is a problem, will continue to complain about it, but then will also continue to fuel the problem, which is quite ironic isn\\'t it? Cars are not worth losing our ability to breath, and if we realize that, then maybe we will be able to breath and see clearly again.Dear Mr.Mrs. senator I believe that you should consider voting against the electoral college. Now you may ask why, but, I assure you that the electoral college is a way for corrupt presidential candidates to win the office and make this great nation a horrible place. To back up my reasoning here are 3 reasons as to why you should consider voting against the electoral college. Segregationists replacing voters of one candidate for another, the election could become a catastrophe if a tie were to happen, there is a chance of a \"disaster factor\" happening.\\n\\nIn 1960 segregationists in Louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose J.F.K. Source 2, Bradford Plumer, The indefensible electoral college: why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, P. 11, line 44 Imagine if the corrupter had been able to corrupt the election, we might have had a fiasco bigger than the 2000 presidential fiasco. If we were to continue to turn our backs on the matter we would soon be run by fatasses who spent all their time gaming and would claim they know exactly how the system works, opposed to a real man who spent all his time rising from the bottom up and knows the system by heart. Who do you think would win if those 2 people were to run for President? Not the one who should.\\n\\nSome people claim an electoral tie is impossible, but, in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election, if that doesn\\'t seem so bad lets take a look at how many people are in the United States alone. In 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 from Hawaii had voted the other way. Plumer, P. 12, line 80 The election is really only a few swing voters away from catastrophe, and possibly, the worst government shutdown these United States have ever seen. So, if 41,971 voters from 1968 didn\\'t seem like alot, then lets look at the 9,246 voters from 1976, ties are seemingly getting closer and closer, what will happen when it is too late?\\n\\nThere is always the off chance of a \"disaster factor\" occuring, like the one in the 2000 Al Gore VS. Bush Presidential election. Imagine if that were to happen again, only, this time, we put a blood thirsty, war hungry, nuclear savage into office. Imagine the Iraq and Afghanistan wars from 2000present and then imagine them being fought on our own soil, imagine, instead of little Iragi children fighting against an invading force, your children fighting against an invading force, and that is just one of the minor things that could happen. Imagine if we put a man in office who thought the way to answer everything was through nuclear war, imagine what would happen to the United States. These are just a few examples of what could happen if another \"disaster factor\" were to happen again.\\n\\nThese are the 3 reasons as to why i believe you should consider voting against using the electoral college. Imagine if We the People actually got to vote OUR favorite president into office on OUR own terms instead of some idiots a political party throws together, imagine how much better off we would be than we are now.Dear Mr. Senate, I believe that we should change the Electoral College to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think we should change it because it\\'s unfair to voters, you can\\'t trust that the electors will vote for who you want to vote for, and then there is the disaster factor\\'.\\n\\nFirst off, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. As Bradford Plumer pointed out in the article, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,\"The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the \\'swing\\' states.\"So basically what he is saying is that if one state already has a lead and the candidate has no chance of winning he isn\\'t going to focus on them. The candidate is only going to focus on the states where he has a chance of swinging the vote towards himhence the term swing states.For example during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all.\\n\\nSecond of all, you cant trust that the electors that you vote for are going to vote for the president you want. For example, what if you want to vote for Obama and so you vote for the elector that says he will vote for Obama, but then when its time to vote the elector changes his mind and she votes for rodney instead. Now what? You put your trust in one person and she didnt vote for who you wanted. Now you might have to wait another four years to have a chance of getting a different president.\\n\\nLast but not least, one of the single best arguments against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor\\'. In the article, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,it states,\"Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.\" The oppsong claim states that we should keep the electoral college. Some reasons stated in the article, In Defense of the Electoral COllege: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,are,\"A dispute over the outcome of an ELectoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000 but it\\'s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The Electoral Colllege requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidatesas we saw in 2012\\'s election to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states. The elctoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.Germany,France, and Columbia,all have something in common, they are cutting down on car pollution. Car pollution is rising problem in the world, making up almost fifty percent of the United states pollution and twelve percent in Europe. From making cars distinct from everyday life to banning all cars for a day,these countries are trying to cutdown on the car pollution build up.\\n\\nOne of the biggest feats in trying to cutdown car pollution is making it an unusual thing in everyday life for a city in Germany known as VAUBAN.This city does not ban cars but even then only about thirty percent of residents in this city own a car and fiftyseven percent have sold their own cars to move here. This city is a home to a mere 5,500 residents, but they all live with in a rectangular square mile. This shows that it is possible to live without cars as personal transport and still be with in reach of stores, work and home.\\n\\nAnother city taking a big step in the fight against car pollution is the well known city of Paris,France. Paris has enforce a partial driving ban in its streets to hopefully clear or cut the air of pollution. The city has made an odd law, \"On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day.\" When this law was first enforced nearly 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. This law was meant to exterminate the smog because the city was rivaling one of the most polluted cities in the world, Bejing,China.\\n\\nOne of the other cities creating a anticar pollution act is Bogota, Columbia. The city of Bogota has created an annual \"Day without cars\" which is fine with the residents. Instead of cars residents use bikes and buses and other modes of transportation to travel around the city. This event has been rubbing of on a fellow cities in the area. The cutdown on pollution here is slight but will slowly make an impact over time when this annual \"Day without cars\" begins to take place in multiple other cities, hopefully, instead of these three cities.\\n\\nAvoiding car usage is a difficult feat to an everyday car user but if you can avoid it then it can really effect the environment in a positive way. Making a day for no cars or at least a small amount of car usage can really impact the environment. This movement has even begun to start in the United States and hopefully will continue from then on into the future when we eventually have a whole lot of fueless cars for everyone to drive in.Zroom! Cars have been developing for hundreds of years all over the world. They have become very dangerous to the environment and there are many advantages to limiting the use of them.\\n\\nThere is only so much space on earth and lot of it is taken up by parking. No matter where you go there will always be parking spots on the fertile ground that we need to preserve. Garages, street parking, and driveways not only house vehicles but they also take up valuable space! By limiting the use of cars we can cut back on the land wasted to house them.\\n\\nAnother important advantage to limiting car use is that it will save you money! Everyday we hear about a new car that just came on the market but the price only keeps on increasing. No one wants a cheap car that they are embaresseed to be seen in and many pay vigorously for new upgrades. The biggest expense is gas, which you will have to pay for almost everyday as the price keeps rising.\\n\\nFinally, car usage is extremely bad for the environment. Paris is in days of nearrecord pollution and its become so bad that they had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Every time you start your car smog comes out of your exhaust polluting the air. After awhile it falls back to the ground and sticks so when it rains the roads become very slick which is a major hazard.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we should all limit the use of cars. Although its ok to use them in moderation they are still space consuming, expensive, and bad for the environment.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: Support for the Electoral College\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in the United States presidential elections. While many argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several essential advantages that make it an integral part of our democratic process.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome. In our current system, the winning candidate\\'s share of electoral votes invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This feature helps to prevent disputes over the results of the election, which would be more likely under a popular vote system. As demonstrated by the 2000 election, even a small plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral vote victory. Additionally, the rare possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote further ensures a clear winner, avoiding any potential complications that would arise in a run-off election.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College fosters the concept of \"everyone\\'s president.\" Since no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates must have trans-regional appeal. Consequently, they are compelled to campaign in all states, not just the ones they are likely to win. This not only ensures that a president will have a broad base of support, but also prevents the residents of certain regions from feeling disenfranchised and ignored.\\n\\nThe existence of swing states is another advantage of the Electoral College. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes forces candidates to devote significant campaign efforts to these states. This focus on swing states encourages thorough voter engagement, as citizens in these states become the most thoughtful voters who shape the outcome of the election. Conversely, under a popular vote system, candidates would primarily focus their efforts on large population centers, neglecting the concerns and interests of less populous regions.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College grants large states the appropriate political weight. By awarding electoral votes based on population size, the Electoral College balances out the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Without the Electoral College, smaller states would receive disproportionately less attention from presidential candidates, who would primarily focus on densely populated areas. This balancing effect allows for a more equitable representation of all states and their diverse interests.\\n\\nLastly, it is important to consider that the popular vote does not guarantee a representative outcome for all voters. Swing voters in non-competitive states, such as Democrats in Texas and Republicans in California, may feel disenfranchised and demotivated to participate in the election. However, the historical voter turnout data contradicts this argument, demonstrating that voters participate to express their political preference, regardless of the probability of their vote single-handedly determining the outcome of the election.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College is a time-honored institution that ensures a fair and representative electoral process. Its advantages, including certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, balanced representation for large states, and avoidance of run-off elections, make it a critical component of our democratic system. While there may be justified concerns and calls for reform, any proposed changes should carefully weigh the potential consequences and unintended effects on our collective democracy.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take into account the important points raised in this letter when considering any potential reforms to the Electoral College. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Why does this country even have this system? Where someone else basically chooses for you? The Electoral College should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. This should change because the people have the right to have their opinion go to what is being voted on,not some else choice also because it\\'s like people are voting for something they don\\'t want foresfuly. The United States is a what we call a democracy meaning the country is lead by the power of the people.\\n\\nSo when two people have an idea to make something better and another person has a different idea they each want to others to hear their ideas. Each person will have their reasons on why they think the way the way they think and the people will have to make a decision on what the they think is best for their community and their country. The United States is a democracy which means it is lead by the people. It\\'s the people say. So when someone votes they expect their vote count against what they are going for. You making a decision and someone else who is higher than you changes it makes voting ironic. Why vote? Just make them do the whole election. \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president\"Plumer. So technically we are not doing the voting we are just what is called \"giving options\" to those who are actually doing the voting. We the people demand to be heard and want what we want. In Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong it states that over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Point being be should be heard no matter what.\\n\\nIn the United States we are not forced to do anything really. Especially when it comes to choosing. Everybody thinks differently so why should someone else vote for the choice of the people. It\\'s like we are voting for someone we don\\'t want when someone higher that you is voting for you. Each stae has their own number of electoral votes but it shouldn\\'t be that way because it the president your voting for is in a tie and he need those votes the people would know that their votes are helping the person they want to see win. But when the electors choose something else the people cant think that. Sometime the electors refuse to vote for the their party\\'s canidate. which makes the situation even terrible.\\n\\nSource 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong paragraph 11 it says \"Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever the please.\" So why even waste time on telling people to vote if someone else will choose for you sometimes not what you want.\\n\\nIn the end having to count so many votes could be dificult and when counting it could lead to mistakenly counted. But we the people make our own desion for our own good. Just imagine someone asks you what you want to eat and get you something totally different.The president of the united states is one of the most powerful political leaders in the world and controls the faith of one of the wealthiest country on the planet. There have been many discussions on how to elect the president of such a great nation. The Electoral College, the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. If its worked for over 200 years why change it. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome and avoids runoff elections and should be kept as the form of election of the U.S. president of our state.\\n\\nTo Begin With, the Electoral College has been used for more than 200 years and our state is fighting for another 200 years of electoral college. In an article by Richard A. Posner called \"In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President\" he states \"there are...reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.\" Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that \"A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons is that the winning candidates share of the popular vote.\" Richard Posner is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidates share of the Electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.\\n\\nFurthermore, The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. In an article by Richard A. Posner called \"In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President\" he says \"nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College 301 and 370. There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invariably produces a clear winner.You get pearly on November 6, 2012 ready to vote, because every vote counts! But does it really? Instead of your vote going directly towards who you want as president, it goes towards the electoral collge and then they decide who really wins the presidency. The Electoral College ia a system where instead of the people vote for the president, a group of electors choose the next leader of the free world. I fervently believe that we should abolish the electoral College sytem, and change the election of popular ovte because it is an injustice, outdated, and irrational.\\n\\nThe Electoral College system is highly unfair. The voters wnat to elect the president that they would like, and in order to do that their vote should be significant. Although the Electoral Collge system is at times efficient, it still does not satisfy the voters. The people aren\\'t even the ones who get an actual say on who their next president will be. Even the people who are in defense of the Electoral College System agree, \"It is the electors who elect the president, not the people\" 15, says Richard A. Posner author of \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing president.\" In the 2000 elections, candidate Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush, and won the popular vote, but did not win the electoral college vote so he lost the presidency. If this is supposedly a \"free\" country with a democratic system, then shouldn\\'t the citizens have the right to pick the individual that will be running their country for the next four years?\\n\\nSome electors may not even vote with the majority. Voters can\\'t control who their electors vote for. The electors are even sometimes picked by the presidential candidate running for office, how does it seem fair that a group of people that hold the fate of our country in their hands is chosen by soemone who would be highly affected by their decision.\\n\\nIt is also an injustice because of the way the votes count. If you live in a state with a higher population, your state gets more electoral votes. The amount of electors depends on the amount of senators and representatives your state has. There is one elector per representative, and two per senator. There is a total of 538 electors, and to win presidency the candidate most have at least 270 or higher. For example sya you live in Iowa, where there are only four electors, the vote doesn\\'t count as much as the votes in California or Florida. The system is completely outdated too. The Electoral College system has been around for hundreds of yars,a dn it is not up to date with our modern times, so it is a complete waste to use it.Cars have made an impression in human history. They have been used to get from point A to B for decades. They may help us but they also can hurt us. Gas emissions are hurting the environment and smog continues to grow. Some governments have already implemented ways to reduce these emissions. These have helped the problem and it may even be to our advantage. Many cities have already sought out ways to benefit the people that have chosen not to use their cars. This limiting of car usage has benefited many countries and the trend seems to be catching on. In the first source, Elisabeth Rosenthal writes that it has made peope even happier than if they had had a car. It has also helped reduce traffic in normally busy streets. The most obvious benefit and advantage to having limited car usage is the fact that the reduced car use has reduced gas emissions. These many advantages may make, not using your car, worth your while.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can be beneficial to the environment and it can also be beneficial to you. It can make for less stressed people. In Source 1, it describes how in a small town in Germany, many people are getting along fine without motor vehicles. As a matter of fact, some even said that they were happier without a car. Heidrun Walter states that \"When I had a car i was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" It may be less stressful because the government there had designed that town so that everything they could need was within walking distance or could be reached with public transportation. Many cities have already adopted this idea including New York. Source 3 has also asked people of their opinion and businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said \"It\\'s a great opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" Carlos had said this while riding a twoseated bicycle with his wife. Walking, Hiking, and even bicycling have been generally seen as a way to distress and relax your tensions. Stepping away from the car and just walking may just be the stress reliever you needed.\\n\\nA usual sight to see in busy cities and on main streets is the amount of cars that jam the street alway the way up during certain hours of the day. This can become increasingly annoying to some people that can be on their way to school or job. A carfree day has had a very succesul turn out in Bogota, Colombia. Source number 3 described the streets of the capital of Colombia to be \"Eerily devoid of traffic jams.\" on that day. So many people might have participated because violators would be fined 25. This carfree day was intentionally placed to promote alternative transportations such as biking or public buses and to also reduce smog. Another example of a type of car limiting was seen in Paris, France. Paris was near a record amount of smog in the air with \"147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London.\" Source 2. Paris took action to try and reduce smog with this simple method: Leave cars with evennumbered license plates at home or face a 31 fine. They proceeded on to the next day with the same concept but this time instead of evennumbered plates, it was oddnumbered plates. This reduced congestion by 60 percent in the capital of France.\\n\\nOne of the more obvious advantages of limiting car usage is the amount of emission that can be prevented from not using your car. In Source 2 it is stated that after 5 days of limiting car usage \"the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescing the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday.\" After just five days of the imposed fines, gas emissions into the atmosphere was reduced significantly enough to lift the ban. If five days made such an impact it can also make a huge impact if many more people were to start limiting their car usage. Car usage has already been falling in the United States. In source 4 it states that \"New York\\'s new bike sharing program and its skyrocketing brdge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorites, as do a proliferation of carsharing programs across the nation.\" This is talking about how all these factors have come to reduce car sales and car usage in general. Less cars equals less gas which would then equal less air pollution.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting your car usages. You may not only be helping the environment but you may also be helping yourself. Using your car less may even make you a less stressed individual. It has been shown to reduce congestions in busy streets. It has also helped reduce gas emission. Limited car usage has started a trend in many countries and may even be a trend here. It can give us these advantages and many more.It is becoming increasingly evident that one part of life many older people took for granted may be going away soon. The invention of the car was revolutionary, but in modern times it seems that many wish to build communities that do not revolve around them. The reason for doing this vary somewhat across the different movements, but one main reason is that recuding car usage will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases and pollution. In fact, many places where this movement has gained traction are cities where pollution was a major issue, such as Paris and Bogota. Another factor is that many people simply are not as interested in cars as they were a few years ago, and have licenses only as a backup. The various movements are spreading all over the world, slowly but surely.\\n\\n\"In a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams,\" said Andrew Selsky of the Seattle times. Bogota, Colombia is notable for being one of the earlier players in this movement, and has shown that it can be effective. Not even rain convinced people that cars would be a better option. \"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,\" said Enrique rivera. Not only have other Colombian cities joined in the movement, but is has inspired similar actions in other countries. It would only be a matter of time before some people would take it to the next level.\\n\\n\"Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars,\" said Elisabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times. While not outright banned, cars are looked down upon in this square mile rectangle, where it is much easier to simply walk or bike. The only places to park are a 40,000 parking garage and inside one\\'s house. \"...Some new suburbs may well look more Vaubanlike, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world...\" said Rosenthal. This approach is gainging ground, as not only does the model inherently reduce carbon emissions, but also is a sharp contrast to 1950sstyle suburbs that previously dominated the land. Another probable reason, however, might be due to shifting interests. You might soon be seeing less cars in general.\\n\\n\"...America\\'s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling,\" said Rosenthal. America may be the home of the classic muscle car, but many people today would rather have something less flashy and more utilitarian. 2005 was the year where the most people were driving in recent times, and ever since then it has been dropping. \"I think that it means something fundamental it going on,\" said Prof. Michael Sivak of the University of Michigan. Many people are simply losing interest in driving cars, while some people simply cannot afford them due to socioeconomic factors. Also, the advent of the Internet and social netowrking has made many people \"feel more conncected\" without the need to drive around in oder to meet someone in real life. If this trend continues, which it is predicted to do, then situations like what recently occured in Paris would be more readily accepted.\\n\\n\"After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban to clear the air of the global city,\" said Robert Differ of the Chicago Tribune. It seems almost surreal for a major city to outright ban driving, but that is exactly what Paris did. Cars are occasionally banned based on their license plate, so as to still let some traffic flow while reducing smog, which had become a major problem for the city. \"...The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,\" said Differ. Of all the European capitals, Paris is by far the most polluted, mostly due to a combination of warm weather and the abundance of diesel fuel. The simple act of banning driving has been a major help in reducing smog, with the skies clearing up enough for it to be considered safe for oddnumbered cars to return to the streets. It still might take some time for other cities to go to measures as extreme as Paris did, but it very well might happen eventually.\\n\\nThe world has seen many communities test the idea of modern carless commuting for us, and we should be taking notes. While copying Paris seems like a risky way to start, communities like Vauban are excellent baby steps, and major cities like Bogota participating in these activities only once a year can get people used to the idea elsewhere. Decreasing carbon emissions is an important goal for urban areas, and for a while it seemed like cars were a neccesary evil. Now, however, it has been shown that life can go on without them. Perhaps further experiments will occur in the future that will introduce the idea to more people, letting others consider various options. Now is the perfect time to prepare for the future.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College\\n\\nDear [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in choosing the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments for both the Electoral College and election by popular vote, the Electoral College provides several key benefits that we must consider before making any changes. The arguments below demonstrate why the Electoral College system should be maintained.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote even though he only secured 51.3 percent of the popular vote. This discrepancy showcases how the Electoral College system can prevent a prolonged dispute over the election outcome. Additionally, due to the winner-take-all method, a very slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory. This adds stability to the system and prevents a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College fosters the notion that the President serves as the leader of the entire nation, rather than being solely the representative of the majority. The requirement for trans-regional appeal ensures that each presidential candidate must cater to the needs and concerns of voters in different regions. By preventing candidates with only regional appeal from winning, the Electoral College encourages candidates to consider the interests of citizens from various parts of the country, making them more likely to be successful presidents who serve the nation as a whole.\\n\\nThirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states, thereby engaging with a wider range of voters across the country. This system ensures that the most thoughtful voters, typically found in toss-up states, have a significant say in deciding the election outcome. By doing so, the Electoral College promotes an election process where candidates invest time and resources in campaigning across different regions, allowing for a more inclusive representation of voter interests.\\n\\nFourthly, the Electoral College balances the political influence of both large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate often disadvantages large states in terms of political weight. The Electoral College helps to address this issue by giving more attention to large states during the campaign. For example, a close popular vote in Florida can result in 29 electoral votes, whereas a similar victory margin in Wyoming would only yield 3. This balance ensures that the concerns of both large and small states are considered in the presidential election process.\\n\\nFifthly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes. This system ensured clear winners in cases like Nixon\\'s victory in 1968 and Clinton\\'s victory in 1992, where they secured a majority of electoral votes despite a plurality in the popular vote. By providing a decisive outcome, the Electoral College system avoids the complications and costs associated with run-off elections.\\n\\nWhile critics of the Electoral College argue that it may discourage potential voters if their state leans heavily toward one party, it should be noted that a significant proportion of eligible voters still participate in elections, regardless of the likelihood of their vote affecting the national outcome. Voters express their preferences and contribute to the democratic process, even if their vote is unlikely to sway the final result.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College system provides certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses candidates\\' attention on swing states, balances the political influence of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These advantages demonstrate why we should maintain the Electoral College to ensure a fair and effective process for choosing the President of the United States.\\n\\nThank you for considering this perspective. I hope you will take these points into account when discussing any potential changes to our current election system. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any further questions or would like to discuss this matter in more detail.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]The time for the automobile is slowly passing. More and more people prefer carpooling and walking then driving a car. Why is that? It could be due to the unemployment rate skyrocketing or less people wanting a car. There are many benefits to driving a car. Being able to get to point A to point B, faster travel time, and it is more private than a bus. But what are the downsides? Pollution, more antisocial humans, and the cacophony of horns and engines. Giving up the car should be on every countries todo list.\\n\\nSome nations, such as Paris, France, find out about the downside of cars the hardway. Pollution is a very real problem in todays society. In 2014 the city had a nearrecord high of pollution, rivaling Beijing, China, the most polluted city in the world source 2. After debating, the French ruling party decided to ban driving for odd and even licence plate numbers on opposite days until the smog count went down. It took five days, but they managed to have most of the smog cleared. Decisions like these cause controversy everywhere, but we have a responsibility to our planet not to destroy it with greenhouse gases.\\n\\nIn a suburb in Germany, they have a carfree neighborhood. They are allowed to own cars but it costs 40,000 and they can only park at the edge of the neighborhood. This alone caused 70% of the neighborhood to not own cars source 1. A woman in Vauban,the neighborhood,said that not owning a car makes her less tense and more happy. With this you can conclude that most of her neighbors feel this way also, otherwise they wouldn\\'t have moved there. Having less stressed people, less polluted airways and less car accidents always sounds like a good solution to me.\\n\\nIn a city in Columbia they have a carfree day, where cars are banned from the city source 3. Even though it was rainy it did not stop people from participating at all. In fact, it has even spread across its borders. A businessman said this was a good way to lower stress swell. Without cars, this city has seen more bikeway paths, parks and community centers being built and rush hour traffic being cut down dramtically. This new trend has promoted people to be more healthy and social. Not only has this affected the airs it has affected business. With more people walking, new restaurants and shopping centers have cropped up. Having more and more people spending their money helps their nations economy in great ways.\\n\\nAfter all this evidence the only conclusion we can come to is that having less cars would help humans immensly. Not only does it promote physical exercise but but cuts down on polution. Yes, it would have hurt car manufacturers but the businessmen don\\'t exactly just lay down and take it. Bill Ford has already suggested working with the new trend source 4. Without cars the obesity problem, especially in America, would decrease. As well as the number of asthmatic people. Taking this data and doing something with it would not only help the life living on this planet, but it would help the planet too.Dear State Senator, In my opinion, Im in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. At first I was all for keeping the Electoral College. But after reading the reasons why we shouldn\\'t keep it I completly agree that we should change it.\\n\\n\"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight race in the \"swing\" states.\" So basically the electoral college doesn\\'t give a fair chance to voters and that\\'s not right. All voters in every state should get a fair chance. \"It\\'s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It\\'s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!\" \"The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.\" Which once again is not fair and isn\\'t right. If people are taking the time to vote then they\\'re the ones who should be picking who the president is. Not the electors. \"When you vote for a presidential candidate you\\'re actually voting for a slate of electors.\" \"The single best argument against the electoral college is what we migh call the disaster factor. Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" This is an example: \"In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.\" Those are a couple great reasons and examples why you should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States instead of keeping the Electoral College.The modern car is a major travel source in which millions of people rely on daily. The issue with this is the struggle of being stopped at lights or being in a traffic jam. The quintessential point here is that greenhouse gases will be lowered in mass amounts if we limit our car usage. Varying countries are supportive of having car free environmentsareas. Some being Germany, France, Columbia, and the U.S.\\n\\nElisabeth Rosenthal describes a community in Germany. Each owner of a house in the neighborhood is allowed to own a car but has to pay a fee of 40,000 to receive a spot. In this neighborhood of Vauban, there is no need for a car because stores are located next to the neighborhood which is \"Placed a walk away\" and is very efficient. \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse emissions in Europe...\" Vauban is in an attempt to lower these numbers because the thought of owning a car here is \"frowned upon\" because all essential stores are in walking distance.\\n\\nThe city of Paris was suffering from a smog epidemic and had to enforce a no driving ban. \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...\" The French people that were usually driving were not here, so roads and major highways freed up which allows for more free room. The smog also was depleting due to a decrease of car usage.\\n\\nColumbia is using a yearly plan for a carfree day which brings open streets to the city of Bogota. The advantage of this limited car usage is the promotion of alternate transportation and reduction of smog. \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza in Source three. When it comes to mind, driving can make a day more stressful which hinders work performance. The outstanding responses from this event brought \"Two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar...\" into the event. \"Parks and sport centers also have bloomed throughout the city...\" The community of Bogota took a chance to bring their lives closer by incorporating new businesses into a walkable distance from neighborhoods.\\n\\nAccording to research, \"Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as each year goes by...\" this also provides less Greenhouse gas effects on the environment. A main factor in reducing traffic jamsgreenhouse gases is the new plans that bring hope to those who are skeptical about switching over to carfree. \"New york\\'s new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls...\" Biking is an excellent alternative to driving because it is fast and efficient. Another plan was provided by the Moblie World Congress, \"Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical...\" As stated, big motor vehicle companies are trying to reduce the practicality of owning a car as soociety turns its head towards a carfree environment.\\n\\nCars are a very fast port of transportation but carry a burden of bad factors. Pollution has increased over the times in which cars have been overused and is the leading cause for an increase in Greenhouse gases. If we limit our car usage, we can create an almost free pollution zone and free up much needed space for other activites than miles upon miles of driving roads.Cars are benefits for getting you from point A to point B, but there are many other ways you can receive transportation that way. Cars can also get you there quicker, but its not worth what we are doing to our environment and ourselves. There are three major advantages about limiting your car use. It will help out our environment with the air pollution you can hear the peacefulness of birds and kids playing, and its a financial rest.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, it will help out with our air pollution. \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...\"14. The gas we use to fuel up our vehicles is polluting the environment when we use it. If we used Paris as an example, we can have odd and even driving days for odd and even license plates 11. That means only half the people with cars would be driving on the road each day which could alter the air pollution. Another reliable example is Bogota, once a year they have a car free day to limit the air pollution 20. Carlos Arturo Plaza believes, \"it\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\" 24.\\n\\nIn addition, the neighborhood or city you are in wouldn\\'t be as loud. Have you ever imagined a peaceful environment with no car horns or engine? Heidrun Walter said she was always tense and now she is happy without her car, because she can hear the swiss of bicycles and the chatterring of children playing 3. Rarely do I ever have peaceful moments unless I\\'m inside school, or at the neighborhood library. For example, a peaceful walk to school can mentally prepare me for my day ahead, and save my mother gas money.\\n\\nThe amount of money one pays for a car could be equilvalent to amount some else pays for their house. Also, when you get the car, you have to put gas in it for your engine to power up. Limited car use wouldn\\'t just effect you as a person, but the economy as a whole. \"In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport\" 9. If we reduced our car usage, the United States wouldn\\'t have to spend 80 percent of appropriations to highways and they could even it out more to other transportation use. Plus, if you didn\\'t have to pay for gas every week just imagine how much money that would save you.\\n\\nLimited car use doesn\\'t just effect you financially, but it also contributes positively to the environment. In additon, more peaceful moments can be added to your agenda of things to do. Cars are reliable for their speed and transportation, but when it comes to long term effects, I don\\'t know if its really worth the risk.At first, the idea of not using a car may seem like an extreme inconvience that comes with endless problems. However after looking into the matter there are many hidden advantages. One can lessen emissions, and help create a less polluted environment for themselves. One may also be able to save money by simply taking alternate types of transportation.\\n\\nBy using a car less, one can help decrease the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Paragraph five by Elisabeth Rosenthal, states that up to fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are due to passenger cars. While these numbers may seem daunting, some cities have reduced their pollution in simple ways. For example, Paris experienced record breaking air pollution caused by emissions. This drove leaders to put in place a ban on certain cars driving during specific days of the week. Not only did the smog clear within one day, but sixty percent of car traffic was down too. If parishes problem was fixed by making a simple switch, then less polluted cities could easily decrease their emissions swell.\\n\\nOne can also save money by avoiding cars. Not only are cars expensive in the first place, but as explained by Rosenthal in paragraph twenty nine, the bridge and tunnel tolls are rising. Bikes on the other hand, are a great alternative because they are inexpensive and they have free paths. One may argue that it is impossible to get the public to ditch their cars for human powered machines, but in Bogota, colombia, this is already happening. For one day each year cars are banned, and only certain types of vehicles are allowed. Selsky explains in paragraph twenty that millions participated, even on rainy days. Here one can see that this alternative transportation idea is not a couple of people, but a widespread movement.\\n\\nOverall, lessening ones usage of cars has many benefits. Not only can one help ensure cleaner air, but they can save money while their at it. By making small changes in ones everyday life, huge impacts can be made on the community.Dear Mr. Senator, Over the course of American history the US has always had an Electoral College, which was designed for untrustworthy ballot counting during the 18th century. Today the world is in the past century and therefore the Electoral College is outdated on a several century basis. The Electoral College should be abolished because it is outdated and creates politicians that only care about the larger states. Even though America is a Republic the vast majority of people believe it is a Democracy, and that they elect the elected politicians as a people, but in truth elect people to elect politicians for them.\\n\\nTo commence, the Electoral College has no need for presense because it is simply outdated. The Electoral College was made for people to elect people to elect a president, which in its entirety is completly unfair, also it was made when a smaller population was present and the ballot counters where unreliable without the use of electronic counters. Now, one can argue that age has nothing to do with the election process because the close ties rarely happen the most recent one in 2000 and before that 1888 but a close tie is not the reason. Today the world lives in a modern era where we know how many people voted for a specific candidate but still we use the electoral college to see who wins what state. For example, Al Gore, the presidential candidate in 2000, \"won the popular vote but lost the presidency\"9, now how is that fair? It is fair because of the Electoral College, where the popular vote isn\\'t always the winner. Clearly, the Electoral College is outdated and should be abolished.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College creates politicians that care not about the country but the large states, which have the most votes. A presidential candidate may forget about small states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina and focus on larger ones, like California or Texas, that foster larger amounts of votes. For example, \"during the 2000 election seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina\"13, but all the big states did. This is because politicians want to win and not focus on what needs to be done and only say what people want to hear. But once again there is always an argument people can argue that the Electoral College wins by region, which explains why some states don\\'t see the candidates, or that big sates allows for political balance. \"So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does\"21.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College should be abolished because it is outdated and creates politicians that only care about the larger states. The US has outdated politics that have no need in todays society, why should the people depend on this outdated system? Also, the politicians only want to win the large states because of this system that does not always coincide with the popular vote. Overall, the Electoral College needs to be abolished.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[United States Senate]\\n[Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n\\nSubject: Importance of Keeping the Electoral College\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to discuss a crucial issue that has been the subject of much debate and discussion in recent years - the future of the Electoral College. As a concerned citizen and a firm believer in the importance of preserving our democratic system, I would like to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College, rather than changing to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States.\\n\\nThe Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers in the Constitution, is a process that strikes a balance between electing the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of electors, their meeting and voting for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of electoral votes by Congress. It ensures that each state has representation and that all regions are considered in the election process.\\n\\nOne of the primary reasons to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the winner-take-all system, where the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. This system provides a clear winner and reduces the probability of a tied election.\\n\\nAnother important benefit of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President elected has trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, and as a result, candidates are obliged to campaign across the country and appeal to different regions. This requirement fosters a sense of representation for all citizens, preventing regional favorites from monopolizing the election and ensuring that the President represents the entire nation.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These toss-up states receive more attention and give a voice to thoughtful voters who pay close attention to campaigns. By concentrating on swing states, candidates must listen to the concerns and needs of these voters, resulting in policies that are more representative of the diverse interests of the nation.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also balances the influence of large and small states. It allows candidates to give due attention to large states, where their policies and actions may have a larger impact due to their population size. This system restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states may lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. It ensures that states of varying sizes have a voice in the election process.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College produces a clear winner. This prevents further complications and expenses associated with holding run-off elections, providing a swift and decisive result.\\n\\nWhile critics argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I believe that these criticisms fail to consider the broader implications of changing to a popular vote system. Eliminating the Electoral College would shift the focus of campaigns solely to densely populated urban areas, leaving less populated rural areas with little to no representation. This would further exacerbate the division between urban and rural populations, potentially leading to political unrest and widening the gap between different regions of our nation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, keeping the Electoral College is crucial for the health and stability of our democratic system. It ensures certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, representation for swing states, balance between large and small states, and the avoidance of run-off elections. It is essential to preserve the core principles of our Founding Fathers\\' vision and uphold the integrity of our electoral process.\\n\\nI kindly request that you consider these points when evaluating any future legislation or proposals regarding the Electoral College. It is imperative that we protect the interests and voices of all Americans in the election process.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration. I have faith in your dedication to serving the best interests of our state and our great nation.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Title: The Benefits of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nIt’s time to consider the advantages of limiting car usage for the benefit of our community, our environment, and our health. The push towards a car-free lifestyle, as shown in places like Vauban, Germany and Bogota, Colombia, offer compelling reasons to consider this shift (Rosenthal, 2009; Selsky, 2002).\\n\\nAt the neighborhood level, reducing car usage translates to cleaner, quieter, and safer communities. Car-free or “car-reduced” communities such as Vauban, Germany offer a vision of less congested streets, where \"the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor\" (Rosenthal, 2009). Away from the noise and pollution of cars, citizens report feeling happier, less tense, and more connected to their neighbors (Rosenthal, 2009).\\n\\nEnvironmentally, the decision to limit car usage can have substantial effects. Tailpipe emissions from cars contribute significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for up to 50 percent in some US areas (Rosenthal, 2009). When Paris faced near-record pollution caused primarily by autos, it implemented a partial driving ban, significantly decreasing smog in just a few days (Duffer, 2014). This example demonstrates how reducing car usage can lead to immediate, tangible improvements in air quality.\\n\\nMoreover, promoting alternative methods of transportation, as Bogota showed in their \"Day Without Cars\", can help citizens realize the feasibility and benefits of a less car-dependent lifestyle (Selsky, 2002). Public transportation, cycling, and walking not only reduce carbon emissions but also encourage healthier, more active lifestyles among citizens.\\n\\nEconomically, reducing car usage could catalyze a shift toward more sustainable industries. Car manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes are already transitioning to being “mobility” companies, offering a broader product range focused on alternative transportation methods (Rosenthal, 2013).\\n\\nA shift away from car dependency may also bring societal attitudinal changes among younger generations, who have been shown to be less interested in owning or driving cars compared to previous generations (Rosenthal, 2013). A shift in car perception from status symbols to merely a means of transport could further reduce car usage. \\n\\nIt should be noted that limiting car usage does not equate to eliminating cars. Instead, it calls for a balanced approach integrating different modes of transport to create connected networks that save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety, as proposed by Bill Ford (Rosenthal, 2013).\\n\\nFinally, as David Goldberg of Transportation for America puts it aptly, \"how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid” (Rosenthal, 2009). Therefore, every little step towards reducing our dependency on cars contributes to a larger, collective effort towards a more sustainable, healthier, and connected society.Car, bikes, walking and such are many forms of transportation. Cars are the main favorite overall. But as time continues we see that the drastic need for cars is growing smaller and smaller because we are now seeing the bigger picture limiting car usage is a bigger plus than a negative.\\n\\nIn Vauban,German the suburb is going \"carfree\". Rosenthal speaks about how Vauban allows cars but there are only two locations where they may park these cars. If you want to park your car you must buy a space for 40,000, and a home along with your parking space. Due to these facts 70% of Vauban families do not own a car. An advantage of this limited car usage is that people like Heidrum Walter speak about how she is much happier and less tense without her car.\\n\\nVauban is in an area that is more accessible to public transportation and closer to stores. The closeness allows people easier accessablity to buses, or walking and biking places. With everything close its easier to get to point A to B. Also reduces pollution and greenhouse gases due to the fact they aren\\'t using cars to get to there locations.\\n\\nIn Source 2 Duffer, speaks about how in Paris bans are being placed against the usage against cars, due to the fact Paris has a high level of smog. Paris had motorists with evennumbered license plates on Mondays leave there cars home or suffer a fine. On Tuesday motorists with oddnumbered license plates were to leave cars home or suffer a fine. The advantage of this ban is that having so many people leave there cars home on Monday allowed the smog to clear enough that the ban for Tuesday was rescind. If Paris were to do this ban for a couple of years there smog issue would be completely gone. This would be a major advantage for them, it would give them less pollution, not as many people getting sick due to the smog, and a less car dependent city.\\n\\nAn event was created in Bogota, Colombia called A Day Without Cars. Which was to have people go carfree for a day. Colombians used many other transportations such as biking, buses, and hiking. This event allowed smog to be reduced due to the fact Colombians could not use a car this day or be fined. Also this event helped spark other areas want to pertake in this event. This was a huge advantage having many other places join A Day Without Cars this meant more areas helping reduce smog and helping many more areas become aware of the fact cars dont have to be the only form of transportation people use.\\n\\nAll in all if areas become less car dependent, there shall be less smog, pollutions and lastly people wont have to travel as far due to the fact everything will be closer. The smaller amount of cars we have, the more positive outcomes.America is the country of the people, the people are the ones in the country, and are the ones living in the country. The method of which the leader of this country are selected by the people is by popular vote. Therefore, the best way, the right way of selecting the president and vice president are by popular vote.\\n\\nStarting of with that the electoral college is unfair. The electors might know more about this country and they think they know what is the best for these United states but they do not. The peoplr know best, the people knows what is actually going on. Just as Bradford Plummer stated in his article\"the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality\"source 14. All these elector are in the political world, so they know everything political about the country and the best leader politically. These elector dont know about all the small things that thousands of people are suffering from.\\n\\nPeople want to have say in their country. If the method of choosing the president was strictly by popular college the people would feel as if the country is not theirs and if they are being controlled. The people who live in the country need to agree because if not then kaos would start to happen. People would protest and this country would fall apart bit by bit. Richard A. Posner said \"to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interest, that he really isn\\'t their president\"source 19. If this is how the people feel when the other president running wins instead of the one they selected won, you could just imagine how they would feel if they did not have a part choosing who is going to be the next president of the United States.\\n\\nThe electoral college is just not fair. Richard A. Posner says that on of the reason to retain the electoral college is \"its lack of democratic pedigree\"source 17. If this country has been running smoothly with popular vote why would someone want to change it? Well manyy times change is good because it is improving becoming better at something although something like this should not change.\\n\\nSo just to restate that eliminating the popular vote would be unfair, unright, and just plain wrong. Just like in the preamble \"we the people\".The electrol college system is an unfair system, people don\\'t have the right to select their own president, they dont have the right to select a president. Because, when people vote they are technically voting for the electors for a candied. That candidate can be a democratic or a republican. In source two it states that electors can choose there opposing candidate. Which declines the the whole voting process. Why do we vote? we vote to select a leader who will defend this country and make america a place of opportunity. The most important reason why the electrol cllege is unfair because of the \" winners it take all\" rule.\\n\\nWe as american people cannot choose their own government, as it says in source two, that when voters vote they are voting for the candidates electors. Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amount of electoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn\\'t have have electoral college, then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair because if the majority of a state for example chose republican candidate, then that would be vague because some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral college, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.\\n\\nIn source two it says that electoral who have been select by the state can choose their opposing candidtade, which is more disatvantgeing to the american people and america\\'s future. for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were \"faithless\" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america.\\n\\nIn source two and three it states the rule \" winner take it all\". The votes the other lose the, winning can take it all, that vote that they take from the losing does not count Because the people really didnt mean to vote for the candidate they don\\'t want or the candidate they dont support, its like your money fell on the floor and someone just took it knowing its yours.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the state senators should eliminate the electoral college because they count the majorty votes, and don\\'t count other votes that is not popular as the other candidates vote. also because they can decide vote on an canditate they want based on their opinions and beliefs. and lastly because of the winner takes it all system which is bascially taking the losing candidates electoral votes.Dear State Senator, it is more favorable to keep the splendid method of the Electoral College and not to change it to election by popular vote for the United States President. The Electoral College method is more preferable because it helps to avoid runoff elections, and less numerical values.\\n\\nUsing the Electoral College to vote is more efficient because of it\\'s aid to avoid runoff elections. As Richard A. Posner states,\" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.\" It also can help candidates running for president to avoid going to states that they know whose vote will have no effect. For example, Democrats in Texas and Republicans in California or how Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43% plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the electoral college. There isn\\'t even any pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority vote that was cast leading to a clear winner.\\n\\nFurthermore, using the Electoral College to select the President can help to reduce numerical values. Even though a citizen\\'s vote doesn\\'t automatically go to the candidate running for office and actually selects the electors that will select the President, the amount of votes it reduced greatly. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, rather than a estimate of 500 million votes total. Only a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect a President. This includes one for each member in the House of Representatives and two for Senators. With most states having a winnertakeall system it even more so reduces the numerical value to that of just electors to vote for the winning presidential candidate while voters in tossup states are more likely to pay closer attention to the campaign. Those voters are more likely to be more thoughtful on average. They also receive the most information and attention from candidates.\\n\\nAlthough, some articles and people consider the Electoral College method to be unfair to voters. Bradford Plumer says,\"Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.\" Even so, knowing their vote will have no effect, they will have kess incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would if the president were to be picked by popular vote.\\n\\nContinuing, as was said before to the State Senator, it\\'s a much more favorable idea to forward with the Electoral College method rather than popular vote because it will help avoid many timeconsuming problems like runoff elections and high numerical values.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage \\n\\nLimiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. As seen in the passages provided, this approach has been successfully implemented in various places around the world, with positive results. By reducing car dependency, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, create more accessible communities, and promote healthier lifestyles.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are responsible for climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can reach up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or public transit, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards a more sustainable future.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality. Cars emit pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can have negative health effects on individuals, especially those with respiratory issues. For example, during a smog episode in Paris, a driving ban was enforced and congestion was reduced by 60 percent, leading to improved air quality (Duffer). Similarly, in Vauban, Germany, where car ownership is limited, residents enjoy cleaner air and a quieter environment free from car noise pollution (Rosenthal).\\n\\nBy limiting car usage, we can also create more accessible communities. In many suburbs, cars are the main mode of transportation, leading to sprawl and the need for extensive parking facilities. However, smart planning initiatives, like those seen in Vauban and other places, encourage compact development and prioritize accessibility to public transportation and amenities within walking or biking distance (Rosenthal). This approach not only reduces the reliance on cars but also fosters more vibrant and livable communities where people can easily access the services they need.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier lifestyles. In car-centric societies, people often spend a significant amount of time sitting behind the wheel, leading sedentary lives. By promoting alternatives such as walking or biking, individuals can incorporate physical activity into their daily routines, leading to improved health and well-being. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was instituted, leading millions of people to hike, bike, skate, or take public transport instead of driving (Selsky). This event not only reduced congestion but also encouraged physical activity among citizens.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating more accessible communities, and promoting healthier lifestyles. As demonstrated in various examples from around the world, smart planning initiatives and car-free events can lead to positive outcomes for both individuals and the environment. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and reevaluating our dependence on cars, we can work towards a more sustainable and livable future.As the global concern for the environment increases with time, the desire to use cars decreases. People are aware that cars release fumes which, when combined, can be detrimental for the environment, and they want to do something about it. Elisabeth Rosenthal writes in her New York Times article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars\", that up to fifty percent of environmental greenhouse gas pollution comes from the cars driven in American suburbs. In her article, she quotes David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, that \"All of our the U.S.A.\\'s development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\". It seems like America, and the rest of the world, is becoming more aware about what cars can do to the environment and that car usage needs to decrease, and they are taking steps to do so. So why should you limit your car usage? By limiting car usage, the average citizen can decrease pollution and harmful greenhouse gases that are causing damage to the environment, improve living conditions in large cities and reduce smog, and feel better in general, with more exercise and less stress.\\n\\nIn the past decade, America has struggled with an obesity epidemic. In the early 2000s, obesity was at its peak, with mcdonald\\'s \"Super Size\" menu options, huge SUVs, and endless television programs to keep couch potatos on the couch. If you visit New York City\\'s Manhattan, you won\\'t see a whole lot of obese people hurrying down 5th avenue to hop on the subway or pick up groceries at the local market. Why is this? Not many people drive in NYC, mainly because it would be far too expensive to buy and park a car in this already monumentally expensive city. The cars one does generally see are either from out of state, taxis, or businessmen who live in the other boroughs of the city. Very few who live in Manhattan drive. Most people take the subway, walk, or use bikes to get around. Because of the way it\\'s made, everything one needs is just a few blocks away, from the grocery store, to the drugstore, to the postoffice, to the bank, there really is no need to have a car. If you have to go to the airport, just take a cab. Naturally, people who walk and bike everywhere are slimmer and healthier. In the suburbs, this is not the story. Many people in the suburbs drive cars out necessity, because it would take the whole day to walk to the grocery store and back. The way suburbs are set up, walking or biking is almost impossible to do if it\\'s not for leisure. Driving around all day to pick up kids, go to work, and finally pull into the home garage can be draining and stressful. If people were to get around and get exercise at the same time, they would be less stressed and healthier. Andrew Selsky quoted businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza in his article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\". Plaza said that, \"It\\'s limiting car usage a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\". Many people are already doing this. Vauban, Germany, is a new \"carfree\" suburb. In this town, things are close together, just like a city, eliminating the need to use cars. It is not illegal to own a car in Vauban, but people who do must pay a heavy fine and pay for parking on the edge of the city that is also highly expensive. People in the German suburb get along fine without cars, because of the way the city was built. The idea of a \"carreduced\" community appeals to the U.S. as well, and legislators and other government officials are trying to make it happen for the environment as well as the sake of the people.\\n\\nBejjing is supposedly the most polluted city in the world, and Paris the most beautiful, but Paris is more polluted than one would think. Robert Duffer reports in his article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", that Paris, after suffering from \"five days of intensive smog\" called for some drivers to abstain from using their cars for the day or face a fine of twentytwo euros. The system was based on license plate numbers. One day, the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be able to drive, the next the ones with odd numbered license plates. This helped reduce smog in the city, which is more polluted than others in Europe like Brussels and London. Once the smog cleared, the ban was rescinded. This ban on cars, although only for a short period of time, is actually a great idea. Emissions from cars cause a large amount of smog to pollute the air, which is bad for both the inhabitants of the city and the environment. The reduction of the use of cars will reduce the amount of smog in the air in large cities, and improve the living conditions in those cities. Almost two centuries ago, smog, soot, and dirt covered Victorian London and its people. This smog was not from cars, but rather from the rising popularity of factories powered by fossil fuels such as coal. Today, all cities of the world are polluted, and almost two hundred years have passed. Shouldn\\'t some improvements regarding the environment and smog in cities have been made by now? There is just as much environmental damage being done as there was in 19th century London, but now, instead of factories being the main cause, it\\'s cars. Although cities are cleaner now, they are just as polluted. In Bejjing, some say the air is so dirty that if you blow your nose, your tissue turns black! It is the 21st century, and we have to be taking strides to improve the environment for the good of the people who live in cities like Paris and Bejjing.\\n\\nLimiting car usage is important to create a better living environment for people as well as improve their wellbeing, but the most important reason is to limit pollution and damage to the environment due to emmisions from cars. President Obama, according to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article, \"The End of Car Culture\", has \"ambitious goals to curb the Unites States\\' greenhouse gas emissions\". If the President of the United States is concerned, this means it is a real problem. The immense amount of greenhouse gases caused by cars has already aided Global Warming and the damage to the ozone layer that exists today. If car usage increases or holds steady, even more damage will be done, so much so that it may become unfixable in the future. If the world does not cut back now on its vehicle usage and reduce environmental damage, things will only get harder to fix. But things are looking good for Mother Nature, because according to all four articles given, including, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars\", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", by Robert Duffer, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\", by Andrew Selsky, and \"The End of Car Culture\", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, people are already taking steps to reduce the use of cars and better the environment.\\n\\nEver since the Model T came out in the early 20th century, cars have become more and more popular in America as well as around the world. They have become so popular, in fact, that they have become a problem. Cars emit harmful greenhouse gases that pollute the environment and cause excess smog in large cities. They can also be stressful and unhealthy for people who depend on them for everyday modes of transport. Limiting car usage is important and will help not only the environment, but also the people of the world.Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Lessons For Urban Sustainability\\n\\nThe familiar hum of automobiles, a sound that has become synonymous with urban life, is noticeably absent in certain corners of our world, and for good reason. The carless Suburb of Vauban in Germany illuminates the very possibilities of urban living stripped of automobile dependence. A place where space is utilized for interaction rather than parking, Vauban provides a glimpse into the numerous environmental, social, and health benefits that can be reaped by limiting automobile usage.\\n\\nFirstly, automobile dependence has been identified as a significant contributor to the global climate crisis. Generating 12% of Europe\\'s greenhouse gas emissions, passenger cars contribute substantially to air pollution and global warming (Rosenthal, 2009). Furthermore, in some automobile-intensive areas of the US, this figure rises to a shocking 50%. Therefore, by reducing car usage, we can significantly lower our carbon footprints, enhancing the health of our planet. The clear air in Vauban is not only a testament to its residents’ commitment but also attests to the more sustainable nature of carless living (Rosenthal, 2009). This is critically relevant in a time of climate crisis where we need to leverage every available opportunity to lower greenhouse emissions and slow down the worsening effects of climate change.\\n\\nMoreover, limiting car usage has marked effects on reducing air pollution at a local level. The air quality improved dramatically in Paris when a partial driving ban was implemented (Duffer, 2014). Similarly, Bogota’s annual “Day Without Cars” also led to marked reductions in smog (Selsky, 2002). For cities like these, battling with smog and airborne pollutants, limiting car usage could be a potent strategy to achieve healthier air quality and improve citizen health.\\n\\nBeyond environmental advantages, reducing car usage lends itself to improvements in the quality of urban life. Vauban\\'s pattern of life shows that communities can be more peaceful, cohesive, and active in the absence of cars. In such environments, street interactions are human-centric; children can safely roam on the streets and recreational uses of public spaces become a norm (Rosenthal, 2009). A wider adoption of such ‘low-car’ or ‘car-free’ models in urban planning can lead to healthier, happier and safer communities.\\n\\nAdditionally, car-free lifestyles can foster increased use of sustainable forms of transportation like walking, cycling, and public transit. This could, in turn, supports public health by promoting regular physical activity. An interesting note is the inter-generational shift seen, with younger generations showing less interest in owning and using cars, choosing instead, more sustainable commuting options (Rosenthal, 2013). This reflects a paradigm shift in transportation choices that can be capitalised on by cities to build healthier societies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage not only holds the promise of creating friendlier and more vibrant city spaces, but also significantly helps to lower pollution levels and greenhouse gas emissions. As we strive to make our cities more sustainable and livable, the strategy of reducing car usage should be integral to our urban planning.Dear Senator [Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you well. The purpose of this missive is to bring to your attention a concern that many citizens, including myself, share regarding our presidential voting system - the Electoral College.\\n\\nThe Electoral College system is enshrined in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election by a popular vote among the people (Office of the Federal Register). However, in recent times, considering our evolution towards a more democratic society, the system has come under scrutiny, with a notable percentage of the population proposing modifications or a shift to direct election.\\n\\nArguments against the Electoral College primarily center on the system failing to truly represent the will of the people (Plumer). Its critics also decry the \\'winner-take-all\\' system, which they argue leads to certain states and voters being overlooked, as candidates primarily concentrate on \\'swing\\' states (Plumer). The potential for \\'faithless\\' electors to betray the popular vote, and the possible disaster of an electoral vote tie throwing the election to a House of Representatives vote, which arguably dilutes the democratic value of individual votes, are also sources of concern (Plumer).\\n\\nWhile these arguments hold merit, it is equally significant to acknowledge the reasons put forth in defense of the Electoral College system. Perhaps most notably, the Electoral College promises certainty of outcome, requiring a candidate to have cross-regional appeal, and fostering voter attentiveness in \\'swing\\' states (Posner). It allows for a clear conclusion, reducing the need for potential run-off elections (Posner). Additionally, the system somewhat counterbalances the mal-apportionment of the Senate by adding weight to large states in a presidential campaign (Posner).\\n\\nHowever, while the notion of abolishing the Electoral College might be an extreme response, considering the \\'proportional representation\\' approach employed by Maine and Nebraska might offer a middle ground. In this way, we can ensure every voter feels adequately represented, fostering increased political engagement and allow for a fair representation of the popular vote.\\n\\nThe choice between maintaining the Electoral College or moving to a direct popular vote is a weighty decision bearing significant implications for our democracy. It is imperative for us to continue this discourse responsibly and sincerely, aiming for an electoral system that faithfully reflects the will of the people while preserving the practical advantages of the existing model.\\n\\nI trust that you—as our state\\'s representative—will consider these points and work toward a more egalitarian electoral system that truly lives up to the principles of democracy.\\n\\nWith sincere respect,\\n\\n[Your Name]\\n[Mailing Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\nDear Mr. Senator, Freedom to vote for authority figures in America had been an ideal image of government all across the world. However, is our privilege to vote really honest and are the results of elections really in our hands like we think they are? The Electoral College System undoubtedly should be abolished because Americans have the right to have full control over who is elected President and, although some may believe that Electoral Colleges avoid the occurrence of a runoff election, runoff elections may be avoided with much more reasonable methods.\\n\\nClearly, election should be determined by popular vote, and not the Electoral College because Americans earned their right to have full control over the representatives in their government. According to Source 2, \"state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and... those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" The defenders could be completely indifferent about the voters choices, or situations where swing states are borderline one party or another, and the Electoral College allows a limited selection of people to make the final decision of millions Source 1. The ballots that we vote in don\\'t even effect the results of the election. It is as if these elections are trying to allude citizens from the fact that the only votes that contribute to the adoption of a new president are the electoral votes. Why bother letting us vote for a president, if only the defenders get to make the decisions?\\n\\nUnquestionably, the Electoral College is not a sound system for presidential election in the United States. In Source 3, Posner states that when there is an unclear plurality in the results of an election, the Electoral College makes it much simpler and more efficient by reducing the number of voters, eliminating the inconvenience factor. This statement appears as a faulty reasoning to have an Electoral College because it is absurd to remove americans right to vote. Maybe, rather than restricting our rights, the result of a runoff election could be resolved by an Electoral College, but the initial vote should be made only by the citizens, fairly. Depending on the defenders to make the final decision of the leaders of our great country is an overlycautious effort to avoid a tie, which could be easily resolved.\\n\\nYou cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country. Citizens would regain their Constitutionalright to vote for the leaders who make major decisions for the entire country. The Electoral College is useful to produce a clear winner in elections, but is evidently not completely necessary and is unfair to voters who want and deserve a say in the outcomePlumer 13, 14. Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider. Thank you.Title: Reimagining Mobility: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe omnipresence of automobiles in everyday life, particularly in suburban settings, has led to significant negative impacts on the environment, health, and quality of life. However, several communities around the world are demonstrating the manifold benefits of limiting car usage, moving towards a more sustainable and healthier way of living.\\n\\nEnvironmental Impact and Health\\n\\nExperts concede that automobiles have emerged as major impediments to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing up to 50% of these emissions in car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, passage 1, para.5). Similarly, Paris witnessed an unprecedented rise in smog levels resulting from a strong dependency on diesel cars, thus leading to airborne health hazards (Duffer, passage 2, para.10-17). \\n\\nBy minimizing car usage, we can significantly limit our carbon footprint and mitigate harmful air pollutants conducive to heart disease, lung cancer, and other respiratory ailments. \\n\\nPromoting Active Lifestyles\\n\\nIn addition to environmental benefits, communities that limit car usage also tend to foster a healthier, more active lifestyle among their residents. In Vauban, Germany, we see the story of Heidrun Walter, a resident, who admits her lifestyle became much happier since she gave up her car – walking and biking became primary means of commuting (Rosenthal, passage 1, para.3). \\n\\nA similar initiative was observed in Bogota, Colombia during “A Day Without Cars,” where residents were encouraged to switch to alternative modes of transportation, like biking (Selsky, passage 3, para.21-24). \\n\\nSuch initiatives help in promoting an active lifestyle, potentially combatting obesity and fostering improved mental health.\\n\\nA Less Stressful, More Efficient Future\\n\\nThe current car-centric urban design often results in traffic congestion and fosters wastage of time and fuel. However, developments such as Vauban\\'s “smart planning” showcase that urban areas can function efficiently without cars. Vauban has fewer parking spaces, stores within walking distance, and a better connection to public transportation (Rosenthal, passage 1, para.2, 6).\\n\\nSimilarly, efforts are underway in the US to promote “car reduced” communities and increase the role of public transport in the suburbs (Rosenthal, passage 1, para.9). In a unique approach, Bill Ford, from the Ford Motor Company, has proposed a connected network that integrates pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic, offering a glimpse into a potentially less stressful, more efficient future (Rosenthal, passage 4, para.43).\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nCities like Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and others foster crucial realisations about the feasibility and benefits of limiting car usage. Such shifts in transportation preferences not only curtail environmental degradation but also encourage healthier lifestyles and more efficient communities. Society, at large, stands to gain from embracing these transformational practices and rethinking its reliance on automobiles.\\nLimiting car usage has many advantages that can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This is evident in various experiments and initiatives around the world that have shown positive results.\\n\\nOne example is the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have given up their cars. With only two places to park, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars and 57 percent sold their cars to move there. The residents of Vauban have reported feeling happier and less stressed without cars. This is echoed by studies that have shown a decrease in driving and car ownership in the United States. Researchers believe this decrease in driving is due to a fundamental shift in American behavior.\\n\\nReducing car usage has a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the percentage can be as high as 50. By limiting car usage, we can contribute to the reduction of these harmful emissions. \\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can help ease traffic congestion and improve air quality. Paris enforced a partial driving ban during a period of intense smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. This demonstrates how reducing car usage can have an immediate and positive impact on air quality and overall traffic flow. Bogota, Colombia, also implemented a car-free day, which not only reduced smog but also promoted alternative transportation and reduced traffic jams.\\n\\nIn addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on public health. By promoting alternative forms of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, individuals can incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. This can lead to improved fitness levels, reduced obesity rates, and overall better health outcomes.\\n\\nMoreover, limiting car usage can contribute to the revitalization of urban areas. By creating pedestrian-friendly environments and placing stores within walking distance, cities can become more vibrant and accessible to everyone. This has been seen in cities like Bogota, where the construction of bicycle paths and the implementation of car-free days have led to the growth of parks, sports centers, and new commercial districts.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, improve air quality, promote public health, and revitalize urban areas. The various experiments and initiatives around the world have shown that limiting car usage is not only beneficial for individuals but also for society as a whole. It is important for us to embrace this idea and support policies and initiatives that encourage alternative forms of transportation.Dear Mr. Senator, The Electoral College is ruining everything that our fore fathers have worked for! When Americans vote, the majority believe that they are voting for the President of their choice, instead they are voting for a group of people, who will hopefully vote for the candidate they had wanted. The Electoral College is wrong for many reasons, but I\\'ll narrow it down to two for you People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote.\\n\\nFirst, The Electoral College is wrong because voters are voting for electors not the President. When voting there are two groups of people voting for the President the People and members of the Electoral College. Members of the Electoral College are actually choose by state legislatures, meaning that their can be a point in time where the state legislature chooses to pick a certain group of people based off of their political party. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the electors from the Democratic party meaning that even if most people voted for Kennedy the president at the time he would still not be elected because electors would not vote for someone who was not apart of their party. It\\'s happen before, so who\\'s to say that it won\\'t happen again.\\n\\nSecond, electors may or may not choose the President based off Popular vote. Even though if we did base the presidential election off of popular vote people might vote based off of region, meaning that most people in the south would vote for someone like rodney, but we have to consider that not everyone in the south would vote for one person. Also it is also true that it electors rarely vote against the Popular vote, but it is possible that the majority of the 538 electors will vote against the people.\\n\\nIn conclusion, The Electoral College should be terminated because People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the Electoral group, meaning that the Popular vote would\\'nt even matter against the Electoral College. Also the Electoral College may acknowledge the Popular vote, but still vote for a different candidate. If you do choose to help me terminate the Electoral College, I say we try to get help from the guy who actually played the \"Terminator\" I heard that he is part of the government system in California now so he could probably help us.In an age of technological advancement and increased awareness of environmental impacts, it\\'s worth examining the advantages of limiting car usage, as demonstrated by various case studies across the world. Advocated by the principles of “smart planning,” curbing the dependency on cars presents several environmental, health, and social benefits. Adopting avenues for limiting car use, cities, and suburbs worldwide have started presenting sustainable models for living (Rosenthal).\\n\\nVauban, a suburb on the outskirts of Freiburg, Germany, provides a compelling testament to the benefits of a “car-free” life, with 70% of its families not owning cars and 57% selling their cars before moving in (Rosenthal). This has instilled a sense of peace and contentment among the community members, fostering healthier and happier lifestyles. Similarly, Bogota, Colombia, holds an annual \"Day Without Cars,\" promoting alternative transportation methods and reducing smog, both important steps toward environmental sustainability (Selsky). Arguably these cases evidence how limiting car usage can enhance the quality of life and contribute to a more sustainable environment.\\n\\nCars, vital to the suburb life in the 20th century, have become a noteworthy contributor to adverse environmental impacts, accounting for a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, cars contribute significantly to the total GHG emissions with up to 50% recorded in some car-intensive areas (Rosenthal). This is a crucial factor to consider, as it underlines the profound environmental benefits of limiting car usage. \\n\\nIn Paris, a city once coated with a choking layer of smog had its congestion reduced by 60% once a partial driving ban was enforced (Duffer). Moreover, the United States has also seen a steady decline in car usage, with significant drops in the number of miles driven per person, particularly among younger demographics (Rosenthal). This indicates that a cultural shift may be on the horizon, with society gradually beginning to move away from a car-dependent lifestyle.\\n\\nAdvancements in technology and shifts in societal norms, such as the rise of carpool apps, telecommuting due to the internet, and renewed interest in city centers, can contribute significantly to this transition. These changes open up possibilities for innovative approaches to planning our cities, which can accommodate less car usage while still ensuring convenience and efficiency (Rosenthal). Public transportation, cycle-sharing, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructures are all elements that can replace the dominance of cars in our society.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage presents an array of advantages for society, ranging from better health and increased happiness to a more sustainable environment. While such a transition may be challenging, international examples prove it to be both possible and beneficial. By adopting smarter planning and prioritizing public and non-motorized forms of transport, we can ensure a sustainable future for ourselves and generations to come.Election by popular vote would be a much better system because Electoral college can be unpredictable and is an unfair method of voting for voters.\\n\\nTo begin, The Electoral College isn\\'t always predictable. In the article Does the Electoral College Work states \"laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.\" This shows that Electors from every state may not be chosen correctly or by trustworthy sources. These Electors may also have different requirements to do their job or how to become an elector, so states will may have different respones from their electors. Another example of this is shown in The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong which states \"Electors could always defy the will of the people.\" This demonstrates that the people who vote for these electors can easily be betrayed by the people they voted for. At any point of time these electors that should be voting for the candidate they are chosen to can change their mind and vote for whomever they please. Clearly, the electors for the Electoral College can be unpredictable and by the time are chosen it may be too late this is why we must change to popular vote.\\n\\nIn addition, The Electoral College is an unfair method of voting for voters. In the article The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong it states \"Candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance winning.\" This shows that candidates aren\\'t even going to certain states because they believe the Electoral College points won\\'t be given to them. This is unfair to voters because they can\\'t even make a proper decision on the president because they may only see one candidate. So this entire state is not fully informed on the election and may chose the wrong candidate when there may be one that shares more of their beliefs in the election. furthermore, in the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep ur despised method of choosing the President it states \"The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.\" This explains that potential voters may not vote because they know that candidate will most likely not win for their state. Depending on what type of people there are in that region race, religion, political point of view they may not vote on a certain candidate. So most voters know their one vote probably wouldn\\'t make a difference. If we had popular vote everyone would have say in who is chosen for our president.\\n\\nTo conclude, We should change to popular vote because by using the Electoral College we allow unpredictable people to vote for entire states and inable voters to have an unfair election.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College and to advocate for its retention in the process of electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides numerous benefits that would be lost if it were abolished.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in a presidential election. The winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes and challenges to the election results, as observed in the 2000 election. The winner-take-all system in most states also contributes to this certainty, as even a minor lead in a state can result in a significant electoral vote advantage.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College guarantees that the president has trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, forcing candidates to appeal to multiple regions and address the concerns of a diverse range of voters. This ensures that the president represents and takes into account the interests of citizens from all parts of the country, fostering national unity.\\n\\nThe swing state concept, facilitated by the Electoral College, is another compelling reason to retain this system. It encourages candidates to campaign in toss-up states and closely engage with voters in these crucial regions. Voters in swing states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign, carefully consider their choices, and make informed decisions. This allows the most thoughtful voters to have a significant say in selecting the president.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also gives large states the political weight they deserve. Without the Electoral College, smaller states would have disproportionately less influence in presidential elections due to their lower populations and fewer electoral votes. The Electoral College balances this disparity and incentivizes candidates to pay attention to the concerns and needs of voters in both large and small states.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This ensures a clear and decisive winner, avoiding the confusion and complications that would arise from further rounds of voting. It simplifies the presidential election process and provides a more efficient way to determine the next president.\\n\\nWhile there are criticisms of the Electoral College, such as the argument that it discourages voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, it is important to note that voter participation is primarily driven by the desire to express a political preference. Furthermore, addressing this concern does not necessitate the abandonment of the Electoral College, but rather calls for initiatives to encourage voter engagement and provide information about the importance of their vote.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system, ensuring certainty, national representation, and balanced political influence. It is not a perfect system, but the benefits it provides outweigh the disadvantages. I urge you to consider these points and support the retention of the Electoral College in the process of electing the President of the United States.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Title: Promoting Sustainability Through Reduced Car Usage\\n\\nIn the face of numerous environmental and public health challenges, limiting car usage has been proposed as a strategy to promote more sustainable and livable communities. Evidence from various sources across the globe supports the implementation of this model in both developed and developing nations, citing benefits such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health, and enhanced quality of life.\\n\\nResidents of Vauban, a German suburb, have successfully adopted a car-free lifestyle, evidenced by 70 percent of families not owning cars (Rosenthal, 2009). The elimination of cars’ incessant noise has resulted in a serene environment where the chirping of birds and the chatter of children constitute the primary sounds (Rosenthal, 2009). Vauban’s model of “smart planning” not only discourages car usage but also encourages an active lifestyle through increased walking and cycling. Such planning initiatives can help other cities combat air pollution, a significant environmental issue that arrived in the spotlight when Paris had to enforce a driving ban due to hazardous smog levels (Duffer, 2014).\\n\\nCar usage restriction, as seen in Vauban and on dysfunctional, smog-filled days in Paris, has also led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a known contributor to climate change (Rosenthal, 2009; Duffer, 2014). The decrease in car usage, and a shift to more energy-efficient transportation methods, reduce environmental impact and can significantly benefit public health.\\n\\nSimilar outcomes have been observed in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, where the annual “Day Without Cars” campaign encourages residents to use alternative forms of transport, significantly reducing traffic and resultant pollution (Selsky, 2002). The campaign has inspired an overall urban improvement effort, including expanding bicycle lanes and revitalizing public spaces, uplifting the urban quality of life and further promoting a culture of sustainability.\\n\\nAmerican behavior illustrates a changing trend regarding car usage, heralding beneficial implications for curbing greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, 2013). In the long run, this could have positive effects on air quality, urban densification, and public health. Additionally, new and innovative commuting arrangements are emerging due to the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps, which provide easier access to shared rides and public transportation (Rosenthal, 2013). \\n\\nIn conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are extensive and impactful. Reduced congestion, enhanced public health, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and a generally improved quality of life can be achieved by fostering a society that values sustainability and propels a shift away from auto-centric communities. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate that a change is feasible and can lead to substantial benefits. Encouraging this transformative shift in urban planning and personal transportation is paramount for a sustainable, more livable future.Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This idea is supported by various examples presented in the passage set. The German suburb of Vauban, for instance, has successfully implemented a car-free policy, resulting in 70% of families not owning cars. This has led to a happier community, with residents feeling less stressed and enjoying the tranquility of car-free streets. Furthermore, Vauban\\'s experiment aligns with a global trend of separating suburban life from auto use, highlighting the increasing importance of smart planning and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars.\\n\\nIn addition to the positive impacts on individuals\\' well-being, limiting car usage can also significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a substantial percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By adopting policies that promote alternative transportation and reduce the dependence on cars, suburban areas can contribute to the global efforts to combat climate change. For example, Paris enforced a partial driving ban in response to high levels of pollution, resulting in a significant reduction in congestion and improved air quality. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can have an immediate and positive impact on the environment.\\n\\nThe success of car-free initiatives is not limited to Europe. Bogota, Colombia has implemented an annual car-free day with the aim of promoting alternative transportation and reducing pollution. This event has garnered significant participation, with millions of Colombians opting for biking, walking, or taking public transportation instead of driving. The positive response to this initiative highlights the willingness of individuals to embrace alternatives to car usage when given the opportunity.\\n\\nThe decreasing trend in car ownership and driving in the United States also provides evidence for the advantages of limiting car usage. Recent studies suggest a decline in both car sales and miles driven per person. This shift in behavior can have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment as transportation is a major contributor to emissions. Moreover, this change in behavior can be attributed to various factors, including advancements in technology that facilitate telecommuting and flexible commuting arrangements.\\n\\nOverall, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various examples found in the passage set. From improved well-being and reduced stress to lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality, there are numerous benefits to be gained from embracing alternatives to car usage. As cities and suburbs around the world adopt policies that promote smart planning and reduce dependence on cars, we can create more sustainable and environmentally friendly communities.Dear State Senator, I think we should get rid of the electoral college because they are unfair. There are only a few reasons to why we need the electoral college. I think we should get rid the college because it is a non democratic method of selecting our president. It should be overruled by declaring the candidate who got the most popular votes. Its the electors who select the president not the people. When you vote, you are actually voting for a slate of electors.\\n\\nAnother reason why would get rid of the electoral college is because of the winner takes all system. Canadiates dont spend time in the states they know have no chance of winning. They only focused on the tight races in the \"swing\" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see the the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not see a single campaign.\\n\\nIt can be argued that the electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, demo crates in texas, or reblicans in California for example. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign thean they would have if the president were picked by popular vote... The voters in presidential elections are people who to want to express a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.\\n\\nWhats wrong the electoral College?\\n\\nWhen we are under the electoral College system , voters vot not for the president, but they vote for slate of electors. For example if you lived in texas and wanted to vote for John kerry, you\\'d vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electorial votes. These electors could be anyone not holding public office. Plus voters can not control who the electors vote for. Voters end up getting confused because of the candidates the electors vote for.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris, and Bogota showcase the benefits of reducing car dependency and adopting alternative transportation methods. By implementing smart planning and creating car-free zones, these cities have shown that there are considerable advantages to limiting car usage.\\n\\nOne major advantage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. As stated in the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing the number of cars on the road, these emissions can be decreased, contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment. Vauban, for example, has achieved a 70 percent reduction in car ownership, resulting in lower carbon emissions and improved air quality.\\n\\nIn addition to reducing pollution, limiting car usage can also enhance the overall quality of life. In Vauban, residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. The absence of cars has created a quieter and more peaceful atmosphere, allowing for more bicycle use and pedestrian-friendly streets. This promotes a greater sense of community and encourages social interaction.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to greater accessibility and convenience. By adopting smart planning techniques, cities can create more compact communities with stores and amenities located within walking or biking distance. This eliminates the need for long and wasteful commutes and encourages people to use alternative modes of transportation. The example of Bogota shows that car-free days can be successful in reducing traffic congestion and providing a more efficient transportation system. This encourages more people to utilize public transportation and shared modes of transportation, resulting in less traffic and greater convenience for all.\\n\\nLimiting car usage also has economic benefits. The example of Paris, where delivery companies complained of lost revenue during the partial driving ban, highlights the potential negative impact on certain industries. However, as the passage suggests, companies such as Ford and Mercedes are already adapting their business models to cater to the changing transportation landscape. By shifting the focus from personal vehicle ownership to alternative modes of transportation, new opportunities for economic growth and innovation can arise.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more accessible and convenient transportation systems, the benefits of limiting car usage are evident. By learning from the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, cities and individuals can embrace this trend and work towards a more sustainable and car-lite future.BOOM! CRASH! BANG! \"911, what\\'s your emergency?\" \"HELP! we\\'ve been in a terrible accident, please get here fast!\"Sirens and horns is what you hear after a terrible car crash. By limiting car usage, we could prevent less car accidentstraffic jams, pollutiongreenhouse gas and we can get more exercise.\\n\\nTo begin with, pollution and the greenhouse effect are really bad to the environment. Car exhaust and other gases are a big contributor to that. How do we do something to help that people ask? Well you can drive less and maybe walk or ride a bike. It will limit so many big issues if you just dont drive as much. Source 3, paragraph 24 business man, Carlos Arturo Plaza says \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" You know what he did after he said that? He rode away in a 2 seater bike with his wife. Thats a business man, and even he doesn\\'t have a problem riding his bike to work with his wife. You can do so much to save the earth. You, can make a difference. You don\\'t have to be the hero, but you can sure do your part to help save the day.\\n\\nIn comparison, car accidents? They are the absolute worst. It not only affects 1 car but it could affect 2 or 3. Maybe even more. Limiting car usage could prevent so many accidents and that means no more hospital visits. Source 2, paragraph 4 says \"congestion was down 60% in the capital of Frnce after 5 days of intensifying smog.\" That means that there was 60 percent less traffic jams and accidents in 5 days! That\\'s an amazing improvement. I always wished that people couldn\\'t get hurt or that I could save someones life, so that what I will try to do. Drive less, or drive only when it\\'s needed. Don\\'t leve your car running. A big negative is don\\'t speed and watch all around you. You can prevent killing someone, not just that, but you can decrease the amount of accidents that can happen. Don\\'t make an asamine choice and drive because you feel like it. Help save this earth. It\\'s really all we have left.\\n\\nLastly, you can get more exercise. Riding a bike and walking is a great source of exercising. Everyone always talks about how obesity is a big problem well this can decrease the amount of body weight you have and you wont put gases into the air. That\\'s 2 problems solved in 1. There are so many things you can do to solve this issue and these are only a few. I see a lot of people riding bikes or walking to school. Teachers especially which shows you that they arent always asking teenagers or new drivers to do it. Don\\'t be the reason the earth is getting worse. Be the reason its getting better.\\n\\nIn conclusion, pollution is bad and so are accidents. But there is always a soulution to the madness. You yourself can make a change. This earth can\\'t take care of itself, it needs your help, so help it. Limiting the usage of your car is a great start. Yes, cars are great and they get you from point A to point B and they can warm you up when it\\'s cool outside or cool you down when its hot, those are all true statements and that\\'s fine it really is. Just limit it and things will start to get a lot better, trust me. It all starts with one person willing to make a change and that person can be you.The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nCar culture has long been a defining characteristic of suburbs around the world. However, recent studies and experiments have shown the benefits of limiting car usage and embracing alternative transportation methods. By reducing reliance on cars, communities can experience improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased accessibility, and a healthier and happier lifestyle overall.\\n\\nOne of the most notable examples of limiting car usage is the community of Vauban in Germany. In Vauban, cars are not allowed on the streets except for the main thoroughfare and a few designated areas. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent even sold their cars to move to this car-free community. Residents of Vauban have reported increased happiness and reduced stress levels since giving up their cars. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to improved mental well-being and a better quality of life.\\n\\nLimiting car usage also has environmental benefits. According to experts, passenger cars are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, automobiles contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing car usage, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. This is especially important considering that transportation is the second largest source of emissions in the United States, just behind power plants.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is increased accessibility to public transportation. In Vauban, stores are located within walking distance on a main street, making it convenient for residents to access their daily needs without relying on cars. This model is being adopted around the world as an attempt to make suburbs more compact and accessible. By placing stores and amenities within walking distance, communities can reduce the need for long commutes and create a more connected and vibrant atmosphere.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can have positive implications for urban planning and development. Traditional suburbs with sprawling homes and private garages, like Levittown and Scarsdale in New York, may soon be outdated. Instead, communities that prioritize smart planning and reduce reliance on cars are gaining momentum. This shift in focus can lead to the development of more vibrant and sustainable neighborhoods, with improved infrastructure and a better balance between transportation options.\\n\\nWhile there may be concerns about the economic impact of limiting car usage, studies suggest that the cultural shift away from car ownership is already underway. Recent research indicates that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This change in behavior can have beneficial implications for carbon emissions, the environment, and personal transportation habits. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already adapting their business models to embrace a broader range of products beyond personal vehicles, recognizing that the future may lie in alternative transportation methods.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for communities. By reducing reliance on cars, residents can experience improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased accessibility, and a healthier and happier lifestyle overall. As more communities embrace smart planning and alternative transportation methods, the traditional car-centric suburbs may give way to more sustainable and vibrant neighborhoods.Politics is everywhere and it rules our everyday lives. Each United States citizen has a role in choosing how our politics can operate. It might not be a huge role but it definitely is an important small role. The presidential election happens every four years on the first tuesday of November. There is an electoral college which is the compromise between election of president by vote in congress and by popular vote of citizens. As state senator, I think you should keep the electoral college running because it is a safer option than just doing election by popular vote.\\n\\nThe electoral college consists of professionals in congress that are more specialized in politics then an average citizen is. The electoral college should be handed the trust to control our politics. There must be a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect that President. Each candidate running for president must have his or her own electoral group. The electors are chosen by the candidates political party, which means the person running for President if in good hands with his electoral college.\\n\\nAl Gore lost the presidency, but he won the popular vote. Maybe the professionals in the electoral college saw a flaw in him that the average citizen would not see. 60% of people prefer doing the direct election popular vote. The direct election would only satisfy themselves temporarily, but what if this president that got elected put the whole country in a downfall. Then people would realize how important the electoral college is.\\n\\nThere are some cases where the election process ends up being a disaster. What if citizens weren\\'t able to chose the electors and the state legislatures were fully in charge of choosing those electors. Well, the electors can still chose to go by what the people want. In 1960, the segregationist almost replaced Democratic electors with the new electors that opposed John F. Kennedy. Some electors have even went against their political party\\'s candidate and only choose who they wanted to chose. The segregationist that were in power at that time only wanted what they thought was best for them and not what was best for the people. Situations like this must require the votes and thoughts of the average citizens combined with the electoral college.\\n\\nThe electoral college has voters voting for electors only and not the president. The electoral college should stick around forever. Popular votes might not always be the best option. The citizens still have a say in which electors shall be chosen and that plays a part in electing the president. Even though voters are not always able to control who the electors vote for, they still have a part in chosing who will be president.Dear state senator , i strongly believe in keeping the electoral college to be in care of the way the elections would proceed instead of changing the outcome of elections to popular vote because voters may not believe in what the candidate\\'s intentions for the people but may like the candidate, it is more organized , and the people would be pleased with the outcome.\\n\\nThe electoral college is a great way of proceeding with elections because changing the way our election system is to one of popularity voting would not be wise because voters may not believe in what the candidate\\'s intentions are for the people but they may like the candidate. There is more of a certainty when the electoral college is in charge for example when Obama was running against rodney he only received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to the 51.3% percent of the popular votes that have been casted for both him and rodney but because of the majority percentage of electoral votes that were casted in his favor.\\n\\nThe electoral college is more organized than a popular vote because if a voter has voted for example Obama for the electoral vote but voted for rodney for the popular vote it would be unorganized because of the split vote between popular and electoral which is recquired the majority of when in a public govermental election which could impact the whole future for the nation. The election for Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 they both had only a 43 percentage plurality of popular votes while also winning a majority in the electoral college which was 301 and 370 electoral votes. When no candidate fully wins the majority of the votes that were casted they wouldn\\'t have to recount the votes of have a reelection which would drain the economies money because of the high amount of money put into one election in the first place just to have another election, whereas the electoral college can just step in and rectify the situation just by producing a clear winner on their own instead of going through a long process just to find out who the clear winner is all they have to do is debate among themselves who they believe the people would be happy with in the long run.\\n\\nElectoral college is the best way because in the long run the people would be pleased with the outcome that they have voted for because if it was turned into a popular vote election people who voted for a specific president wouldn\\'t have won just because they aren\\'t popular amongst the people that are voters iin that year\\'s election. However the popular vote election may also be a good idea because if the voters cast a vote for you in the popular election that should essentially like your intentions that would benefit the countries needs and demands that are recquired for us in the long run.\\n\\nTherefore the electoral college should stay in charge of all decsions having to do with the elections for new presidencey when the time time comes because if it was changed to popular vote people would vote for the candidate that they like the best instead of the candidate with the best intentions for the nation, it is considerably more organized than a popular vote election , and the people would be end up being pleased with the outcome in the long run.Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit society. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can combat the issue of greenhouse gas emissions, create more compact and accessible communities, and improve the overall quality of life.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By limiting the number of cars on the roads, we can effectively decrease these emissions and mitigate the detrimental effects of climate change. This is especially important considering the increasing number of private cars owned by the middle class in developing countries, which are contributing to the pollution of cities.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more compact and accessible communities. The passages explain how new approaches to suburban planning, such as in the German suburb of Vauban, involve placing stores within walking distance rather than on distant highways. This not only encourages residents to rely less on cars, but also promotes healthier and more sustainable living. Additionally, these developments often prioritize public transportation and have limited parking spaces, making it more convenient for people to use alternative modes of transportation.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in the overall quality of life for individuals. The passage describes how residents of Vauban, Germany, who have given up their cars, report feeling happier and less stressed. This is because relying on cars can be a source of tension and anxiety, whereas other modes of transportation, such as biking or walking, can be more enjoyable and relaxing. Additionally, reducing car usage can lead to less congestion on roads, resulting in faster and more efficient travel for everyone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage can have significant advantages for society. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create more compact and accessible communities, and improve the overall well-being of individuals. By implementing smart planning strategies, such as those seen in Vauban, Germany, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can work towards a future with less reliance on cars and a more sustainable and livable environment.Driving can be a huge hassle. Having to spend money on gas, making sure to not go over the speed limit, and being a safe driver at all times to avoid any accident. There are many advantages to limiting car usage. Such as helping out our economy and reducing pollution, having alternative ways to get places, and not spending money on a car. In not driving you would be the one to benefit from it.\\n\\nLiving in a world that constantly looked beautiful and being able to breath in clean air would be a wonderful thing. We could all make this happen by not driving so often or at all. Cars let out gases that ruin our air. Excessive driving with all the fumes coming out damages our air. Not driving can make a tremendous difference. In \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" according to Duffer in paragraph 5 he described, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog.\" After banning driving, France managed to make a stunning change.\\n\\nTransportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants. There are many alternative ways to get places. Such as riding a bus, walking, biking, and so much more. Public transportation is nothing to be afraid of. Doing so helps our community. In the passage \"In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars\" according to Rosenthal in paragraph 7 he suggests, \"all of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,\\' said David Goldberg, and official of transportation for America, a fastgrowing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States... who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars.\" Spending money on a car takes big bucks. There are an abundant amount of other alternatives than spending money on a car that damages the ozone. There are other ways to put your money into good use than spending it on a car. The amount of people wanting to do this could lead to negative implications for the car industry. In \"The End of Car Culture\" according to the author in paragraph 6 she implies, \"Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves \"mobility\" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.\" In conclusion, there are many advantages of limiting car usage. Help not just your community, but the world. Every little thing matters, no matter how miniscule your action is. Not driving helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, saves a big part of your money, and you have alternative options for transportation. Think of the ways you will be helping our world.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, Zip]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, Zip]\\n\\nDear [Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and argue against changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I have thoroughly studied and analyzed the information and perspectives provided in various texts, and I believe that the Electoral College system has several benefits and should be maintained.\\n\\nThe Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, serves as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote. It consists of 538 electors, who vote for the President and Vice President based on the state\\'s popular vote. Each state\\'s allotment of electors is determined by the number of representatives in the House of Representatives, plus two for the Senators.\\n\\nOne of the advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winner of the electoral vote usually exceeds their share of the popular vote, preventing close contests. Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes ensures that a slight plurality in a state results in a substantial electoral victory, preventing ties in the nationwide electoral vote.\\n\\nAnother benefit of the Electoral College is that it demands trans-regional appeal from presidential candidates. No single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Consequently, candidates must appeal to voters from various regions, preventing the concentration of power in one area. This encourages a president-elect to represent the interests of all regions and fosters a sense of inclusivity.\\n\\nThe focus on swing states is another advantage of the Electoral College system. Candidates direct their campaign efforts towards states where the electoral vote outcome is uncertain. This encourages voters in swing states to pay closer attention to the campaign, making them more thoughtful and informed voters. Elections should be decided by those who have thoroughly considered the candidates\\' policies and qualifications, and swing states provide voters with that opportunity.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College provides balance to the political influence of large states. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, large states have less weight in the political process. However, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to these states during the campaign. Even if the popular vote is close, as exemplified by Florida in 2012, winning a large state results in a significant number of electoral votes.\\n\\nFinally, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This avoids the complications and costs associated with organizing run-off elections and ensures a decisive result. As we have seen in the past, candidates who win a majority in the Electoral College but only a plurality of the popular vote can effectively govern and lead the nation.\\n\\nWhile the arguments against the Electoral College have been raised, such as the potential disenfranchisement of voters in non-competitive states and the perceived undemocratic nature of the system, the practical benefits of the Electoral College outweigh these concerns. It is important to weigh the historical significance and the intent of the founding fathers in establishing this system, aiming to create a more balanced and representative democracy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages attention to swing states, balances the political influence of large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. These practical advantages support the retention of the Electoral College system. I urge you to consider these points when weighing the decision on whether to keep or change our current method of electing the president.\\n\\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will take my arguments into account when considering the future of the Electoral College.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and the environment. This trend is becoming more popular around the world, as exemplified by Vauban, a car-free suburb in Germany, and car-free days in cities like Paris and Bogota. By reducing car usage, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative modes of transportation.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars contribute significantly to these emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some areas of the United States, this percentage can go up to 50 percent. By limiting car usage, we can greatly reduce these emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.\\n\\nAnother advantage of reducing car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation modes. In the car-free suburb of Vauban, for example, residents rely on public transportation, biking, and walking to get around. This not only reduces the dependence on cars but also promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle. In cities like Paris and Bogota, car-free days have encouraged people to explore other means of transportation such as buses, taxis, biking, and walking. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also improves air quality and reduces noise pollution.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can create more compact and accessible communities. In Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than being located in distant malls. This encourages people to walk or bike to their daily needs instead of relying on cars. Similarly, the car-free days in cities like Bogota promote a sense of community and social interaction, as people participate in alternative modes of transportation together.\\n\\nThe trend towards limiting car usage is not only limited to developed countries but is also gaining momentum in developing nations. In countries like Colombia, car-free days are becoming more popular and are spreading to other cities. This shows that reducing car usage is not just a localized solution but a global movement towards sustainable and livable cities.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and creating more accessible communities, we can contribute to a more sustainable and healthier future. As more cities and communities around the world adopt car-free initiatives, it is clear that this trend is here to stay.What is a normal day to you? Waking up, brushing your teeth, eating, then getting into car to go to work, right? That last object in that list, getting into your car, puts a strain on the environment, commonly known as pollution. Although the amount of strain that an individual may put on the environment is miniscule, the combined output of all cars in a city may be enough to damage your lungs! In Beijing, China, people wear masks outside to prevent inhalation of the dense smog surrounding the city. This has led to the development of the \"smart planning\" movement, in which city planners build dense suburbs in which cars are unneeded. Shops are a walk away, and your neighbor lives five minutes from your home. You may be asking \"Why do I care about this? I don\\'t have heavy smog in my city.\" Well when car use starts to increase in your city, that will affect both your health, and your happiness.\\n\\nFirst off, limiting car usage will make you happier. \"How will this make me happy?\" Think about this, you go through your usual morning routine, and you only have five minutes to get to work. That\\'s perfectly fine because, good news, your job is a three minute walk from your house! This drastically reduces stress as said in this quote from \"In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars.\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. \"when I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\\' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.\" Secondly, the smog from cities with high car usage is becoming unbearable. \"Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.\" In Paris, after a few days of \"nearrecord pollution,\" enforced a partial, temporary driving ban. \"On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following da y.\" The congestion levels of Paris were down by an astonishing sixty percent after five days of the smog. Imagine that, in five days smog levels reduced by sixty percent. Imagine what the whole world could do if everyone pitched in to this trend. \"Automobiles, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emmisions from tailpipes....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.\" Lastly, a reduction of car use can vastly improve the economy. In Bogota, Colombia, the local government have begun to enforce a \"Day Without Cars\" in an effort to curb rising pollution levels. This has been happening for three years, and has increased profits for small shops and eateries in the area. Because of the large number of walkers and bikers, shops were able to make a larger profit with walkins that just happened to pass by the store. This is what caused more stores to open up, thus boosting the local economy. Even businessmen are enjoying these days as stated by Carlos Arturo Plaza. \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" To end this off, cars use can be greatly reduced. It is a matter of willpower, which everyone has, but some are too lazy to tap into it. The reduction of car use will have long term effects on both you and the globe. By minimizing the time you spend in a car, you are increasing your happiness, decreasing pollution, and helping boost the economy! If you think cars are a necessity in today\\'s shrinking world, think again. New York is a perfect example in which rush hour traffic makes it impossible to get to work on time by car. Even in new small suburbs, cars are becoming a thing of the past. Tomorrow, instead of driving to work or to the store, try walking. You just might enjoy it.Car emissions are very deadly and dangerous. They can be lethal to humans, and also dangerous to the environment. It can lead to big environmental issues like global warming, holes in the ozone, and air pollution. Many ignore the fact or are oblivious to it, but driving hurts our environment just for a little bit of convenience. Are cars doing more harm than good?\\n\\nCars have a convenient way of getting us to our destination faster but at the cost of our precious environment. We use our cars sometimes without thinking twice of what the actual after effect is. Paris is a city that has had almost, if not the worst, smog levels in all of europe. It has 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter due to the majority of cars which have diesel powered engines. Air pollution doen\\'t just effect our atmosphere, it slowly kills, if not severly injures, animals and people. It hurts us by causing major damage to our lungs and respiratory system.\\n\\nGreenhouse gases are another major thing in car emissions. Greenhouse gases are gases that keep or trap heat on earth to keep us from going into another ice age. A decent amount is good and is used to do its job, but when you have too much then the globe starts to increase in temperature. Antarctica, as you know, is made of ice. when ice gets to a certain temperature it starts to turn into a liquid. So when antarctica starts to melt into the sea, the general ocean level will rise, causing sea level cities, states, and countries start to flood with salty ocean water. If we cut down on gas or diesel car travels, the and greenhouse production rate would slow down and so will the rising temperature of the earth decreasing the speed of the melting arctic.\\n\\nCars are a very important and convenient way of travel but can be very deadly to us humans and tne earth we live on. Because we use them everyday doesn\\'t mean that we can not cut down or change our ways of transpertation. Cars give off many harmful toxins and gases that we can, but refuse to control. we can cut down on the majority of the waste by limiting our car trips distance wise and based on how many times you leave the driveway. a simple change as in riding a bike or walking or even only going out when needed can slow down the speed of global warming and even drop the levels of air pollution. A little change can maybe just save the earth from another flood that can wipe out humainity.Cars have been around since the early 1900\\'s, but now it seems there is no need for them. The younger generations have not been getting drivers licences and technology is making it easier to ride with someone else or telework. It is an all out war against automobiles and the United States isn\\'t the only one fighting in it. Vauban, Germany, bogota, Columbia, and Paris, France have all joined the war against personal cars.\\n\\nHow to win a war against cars stop owning them. Vauban, Germany\\'s population is doing just that. Over half of vaughn\\'s population sold theirs cars so they could live in Vauban, and over seventy percent don\\'t own a car. If people don\\'t own cars, then there is no need for parking. Now, without parking lots or garages all over the place stores and schools can be closer to home. For those that require a car to get to a farther away work there are two parking garages, but to own a spot in one of them one you must buy a home there and pay forty thousand for the parking space. Residents of this experiment have even gone to say that without a vehicle they are less stressed and happier.\\n\\nJoy was not what Paris commuters felt when France closed down the streets to certain vehicles for one week. Why would they close the streets smog bad enough to rival one of the most polluted cities in the world. Paris is usually the European city that has all the smog, 147 micrograms to London\\'s 79.7. So the government decided to do something about it. For five days they alternated from even licensedplate cars could drive to odd licensedplate cars could drive. To appease everyone without cars the government made public transportation completly free allowing those without vehicles to still get to where they needed to go.\\n\\nIn the war against cars public transportation has played a big role. Take the city of bogota, Colombia for example every year they have a completly car free day where everyone takes public transportation or walks. Due to the day without cars public transportation is better than ever, as are the sidewalks. Busses have nicer interiors and are more accomodating, and old, cracked sidewalks have turned into smooth, flat sidewalks that are safer for everyone.\\n\\nSome might say that it is impossible to live without cars, because of illnesses and the lack of safety. However, in Vuaban, Germany people are less stressed which acounts for many immune systems shutting down. In Paris, France they were able to clear their city of smog in five days, without smog there would be nothing to hide the sun on a nice day letting people get vitamen C also while keeping their lungs clear. In bogota, Colombia public transpotation and sidewalks have improved tenfold since the day without cars started as has safety. Without cars there are no accidents, people cannot injure others by drunk or reckless driving, and it allows the police to watch for crime instead of speeders. Overall our society would benefit grately from becomeing carless.Dear Senator, We the people of the United States of America, desire a president who will not only care for the wellbeing of the citizens, but know what to do during times of crisis. The Electoral College is but one method of deciding this. There are many reasons as to why we need the Electoral College, and there are many reasons one can list of why we do not need it. If we were to get rid of the Electoral College completely and determine the win on the vote of the American citizens, chaos would ensue. Let\\'s be honest, there are plenty of voters who have no idea what they are doing. If America were to base who would lead and call the shots of the country on the votes of everybody, then one person would end up being in office who is no better a ruler than a goldfish.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is noted as a process, not a place. This is correct. You don\\'t just walk up to the Electoral College and say \"hey, this is who you should put into office\". Each state in the U.S. has a certain number of representativeselectors. For example, D.C.is treated like a state has 3 electors. People may say that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated. While in some aspects this can be true, but if the electors know what they are doing and are willing to stay true to their country, then maybe the correct person would be elected in. The EC is known to require a Presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. A transregional appeal is when one area of the U.S. is known to be in favor of the presidential candidate.\\n\\nAmong the other things the Electoral College is known as being, it has been widely regarded as an anachronism. An anachronism is a person or thing that seems to belong in the past and not fit into the present time. While yes, the Electoral College is very old, it does have its uses. It is perhaps one of the final things that will determine what direction this great country gets set into, be it forwards or backwards. The larger the population of a state, the larger number of electors it has. Most of the states in the U.S. have what is called a \"winner takes all\" system. This system will award all of the electors to the presidential candidate that wins the election.\\n\\nRichard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, what is known as the AFLCIO, and the U.S Chamber of Commerce all agreed on just one thing. That thing that they all agreed on was to abolish the Electoral College. Over sixty percent of the U.S. population would rather have a direct election over what we currently use. Out of all the arguments against the Electoral College, one of the \"best\" is the Disaster Factor. One of the other worrying views on the Electoral College is what would occur if there were to be a tie in the vote. If a tie were to occur, the election would thus be thrown in the hands of the House of Representatives.\\n\\nWhile there are many reasons to like, and dislike the Electoral College, one of the most reassuring should be that it most of the time will keep idiots out of the Oval Office. Among the reasons to dislike the Electoral College is that it is unfair, and keeps the majority of American people from using their voice. The Electoral College is the fine line between a country going backwards and causing the rest of the world to hate it, and a country going forwards, causing the rest of the world to hold it to a higher degree. If theres anything that the American people should want, it is a powerful and respectable leader who will do anything and everything they can for the citizens. Sincerely, An American.Dear state senator, There should be a change in the Electoral College. It should be changed to electing presidents by popular vote. It is our right to vote for someone who would actually make changes in our society and make our lives different. The fact that we have to vote electors for those electors to choose our president, it seems unfair. Also, the purpose of voting for president is for everybody to vote not just citizens. Therefore, there should be some changes for voting.\\n\\nTo continue, election of presidents by popular vote should be used in the United States. If we are voting for presidents, then why should us ,citizens, vote for electors in order for them to vote for our president? As stated in source 2 \"The indefensible Electoral College\",\"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state,candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\"states.\" In addition, it states in source 3 \"In defense of the Electoral College\",\" No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" This shows that with the Electoral College, not every region is going to have electoral votes. Therefore, it would not be fair for those regions. Perhaps their votes would not count and basically the chosen president would not pay attention to them.\\n\\nFurthermore, everyone should be allowed to vote not just citizens. The fact that not everybody are qualified citizens to vote, then the amount of votes would be vague. This process is similar to not having enough electoral votes. The votes would not be popular or in a great amount for that specific place. For example, as it mentions in source 3, \"Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...\" There should not be any thoughtful voters deciding on the election. It makes it unfair for those who want to vote but are not allowed.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Electoral College could have benefits. In this process it is easier for the electors who are voting. If there is a tie in votes, then they can pass it on to the House of Representatives in which state delegations take care of the voting. At least with this process, they have their own system set up and if any problems, they know in what way it can be fixed. Unlike voting by popular vote, it can cause some problems because not everyone is allowed to vote and there could be few votes for candidates which would have a negative outcome. However, it would be the same for the Electoral College because there would be not enough electors in regions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, election by popular vote for the president of the United States should be used. It could change society and it will allow us to have a better living. This could give us a chance to vote and feel part of the election.The majority of people use some sort of gas transportation such as a bus or a car. It is a good idea to limit the usage of gas transportation to help save our environment, to help our own health and to save money. Cars are very popular nowaday but are also bad for everyone and for the world we all live in. Limiting car use will be better for all of us.\\n\\nCar usage is extremely bad for our environment. According to the first article in paragraph five a total of about 62 percent of gas emission in our environment iin Europe and the United States are because of cars. That is lot, and to think that limiting the usage of cars or eliminating it will help better the environment and world we live in. As stated in the fourth article in paragraph 29 that every year our environment betters due to less people buying cars and getiing licenses.\\n\\nHealth is a big issue everyone faces. The more cars our used the more contaminated the oxygen we breath gets. We can not afort to let the air we breath get contaminated. In the second article throughout the whole reading Robert Duffer the author says that in paris smog is everywere. That fog absorbs all the gas that the cars release. Think about it, that poluted fog is n the air and you can not help breathing it. Once you breath that fog you are putting your health at risk.\\n\\nEvery car i money you have to waste out of your pocket. You waste money when you buy the car, when it breaks down, and even everytime the car is low on gas. If you put that all together you are wasting lost of money when you could be saving it and using on other things. In article one in paragraph two in the last sentence the author put how much money is wasted to be able to have a car which is about 40,000. Having a car means getting fines if you do something wrong or improperly as showed in paragraphs 11 and 21.\\n\\nIn conclusion, cars are not good for the environment, our health, or for our money. Use cars less or do not use them at all. Everyone needs to end car use. Make a change, it is all up to you.In the old world, people didn have car\\'s, they did everything on foot. They got food, ran errands, and just to get out of the house with the family. So how come now adays people are so dependent on their car\\'s. Places around the world are implementing rules or laws now to stop people from abusing the car.\\n\\nSince the car was invented it has always had the same issue, not the engine or the interior, but the environmental issue. And now that people around the world are realizing that, they have created rules and laws to ban or reduce the usage of cars. A community in Germany called Vauban have given up their car\\'s to help the environment, and people love it. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two.\\n\\nParis \"The Love City\" in France has Banned cars because of the high amount of smog it creates. After the law was placed, only after five days, congestion was down 60 percent.\\n\\nParis has the most smog compared to any other European capitals, they had to do this or the smog would take over the city. And since the ban has been posted, smog has been clearing and is now much more limited in the area.\\n\\nMajor cities like New York were built in a narrow way, so its more congested when too many people are driving, and the buildings are much closer together so its more continent to walk or bike to places rather than drive. New York has implemented a new bikesharing program, and it is a hit. And around the nation a similar program is the carsharing program. It encourages people about car pulling, it is when multiple people go to work or school in the same car, it puts less cars on the road and has plentiful benefits. Like less carbon dioxide in the air, less traffic, and saves on gas money.\\n\\nBill Ford, an executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, pitched a plan to live in a world that owning a personal car was impractical. He proposed to partnering with telecommunications industry to make a city or many where the \"pedestrians, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety.\" Banning cars around the world isn\\'t a solution because they are more continent than taking a train or walking, but their needs to be a cut down on the amount we use a car, we abuse it. Eventually all the greenhouse gases might end up destroying the planet we live on. But their are solutions, implementing a world day were we dont use cars would help tremendusly, their are other means of getting around other than car. For example Biking is a great form of excersice and will get you to were you need to be faster than walking, while getting in shape at the same time.Dear State Senator, The Electoral College is widely acknowledged for serves a purpose as a method of selecting a president and vice president, not a legitimate college. The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution as a compromise between having the President elected by a vote in Congress and an election by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This process of choosing a president needs to be modified into popular vote for the reasons that the Electoral College was established to actually vote a slate of electors, voters feel disenfranchised, and is unfair to voters.\\n\\nTo begin with, the Electoral College was actually established for voters to vote for a series of electors, which then get together to have the final decision. Stated in \"What is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register, \" The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise...process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" This means that under this system, voters don\\'t vote for the president, but for electors who then elect the president. The voters sometimes aren\\'t told full front that they are chosing someone else and not always can they control who their electors are voting, leaving many puzzled. Voters aren\\'t to be puzzled. They are to vote who they\\'d like because it allows them a freedom to express who they want because they are strongly acknowledged of the troubles of their society and how they should be handled.\\n\\nIn addition, the Electoral College makes voters feel discouraged and disenfranchised. According to \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner, it is stated, \" No region...has enough electoral votes to lect a president...residents of the other regions are likely to feel...that their votes do not count...that he really isn\\'t their president.\" This means that voters feel that the president they chose is their president because they believe their votes count.\\n\\nfurthermore, the Electoral College is unfair and irrational to voters because the candidates they \"vote\" for don\\'t spend time with them. Sizes matter to the candidates. According to \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer, it is stated, \"...the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates do\\'t spend time in states they know have no chance of winning...\" This quote conveys that because some states are small in population and size, they will not help the candidate succeed. This is immensely discouraging to the voters because they feel worthless for not being big in size. Candidates should not have an excuse to not thank all their voters because every vote counts, not matter how small.\\n\\nAdmittedly, the Electoral College allows a clear and certain outcome because it exceeds the popular vote, however, the method is actually turning off potential voters for a candidate. The popular vote allows every voter to express their opinions because the overall vote chooses the popular president.\\n\\nIn the final analysis, a change is needed because with the Electoral College many candidates are losing potential voters considering that the qualified feel that they arn\\'t doing much by voting considering they aren\\'t voting for the president, but a gamut of electors to vote for them. They alos express the feeling of discontent and unfairness because they feel that they don\\'t count and know they have no chance at winning.This country is built on democracy, the idea that all of its citizens have rights and a say in how the country is run. The Electoral College takes away the peoples vote, because in an election, the eligible citizens vote for a candidate, but in reality they are voting for a group of electors who will then vote for the candidate. I believe this is unfair and that the Electoral College should be removed from the country\\'s government.\\n\\nThe first flaw with the Electoral College is that voters cannot directly vote for their favorite candidate. In Source 2 paragraph 10 , it says \" ... voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\\n\\n\" If citizens of the United States can\\'t vote for their own president directly then it takes some of the democracy out of the country. It rarely happens but the electors don\\'t always vote for the candidate with the most popular vote, they can vote for whoever they want, if they really wanted to. This is just one reason I think the Electoral College should be removed, and replaced by a popular vote.\\n\\nMy next reason for replacing the Electoral College with a popular vote is that a tie in the Electoral College is possible. In Source 3 paragraph 18 , it says \" A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538is an even number...\\n\\n\" If a tie occurs then the vote goes to the House of Representatives, but how will they know the feelings of voters if they vote one party for Congress, and another party for president?\\n\\nMy final reason to get rid of the Electoral College is that a candidate can win the popular vote, but lose the election. In Source 2 paragraph 9 , it says \"...\\n\\nAl Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the poular vote but lost the presidency...\\n\\n\" If the people\\'s favorite candidate wins the popular vote, a vote representing the country\\'s citizens, but loses the election because of the Electoral College then the system is unfair to voters.\\n\\nSource 3 paragraph 19 , \" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to select a president.\\n\\n\" But this country should be about how the people vote, a popular vote would be the same, no region would have enough eligeable voters to elect a president, so a candidate would have to campaign all over the country.\\n\\nIn conclusion I think the Electoral College should be replaced with a popular vote. Voters cannot directly vote for thier choice candidate, ties can occur in the Electoral College, and a candidate can win the popular vote, but somehow still lose the election.I have never liked Government intervention on decisions that should be left up to the people who feel the effect of mandate. However, Government intervention on limiting the amount of car usage may prove to be a genuinely good cause. It may prove to accomplish what Government was first formed to do help shape the world to make it a better place to coexist, not only with each other, but with the whole Earth.\\n\\nAt fist, it may seem a little crazy in our day and age to actually reverse the climb of our use of technology and innovation, like vehicles. After all, isn\\'t that what we\\'re supposed to do? Isn\\'t it natural to constantly evolve as time passes? Well, cars aren\\'t natural, and they destroy what is.\\n\\nWe are facing dangerous pollution \"After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\" Source 2, 10. This is alarming to me and many people who care for the Earth. Every day, we\\'re facing new headlines of negativity, and although whether Kim kardashians dress fits or not is upsetting, I think we need to focus on more important things and expell the negativity we\\'re always bashed with. We could be developing things that will really make an impact, like new breakthrough sciences on space, medical sciences, and so much more. Instead, \"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\" Source 1, 7.\\n\\nBut, there is hope in all this. Already, we\\'re seeing improvements. \"The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company\" Source 4, 32. Maybe reversing the climb of our use of cars isn\\'t so hard after all we can hit the ground running.\\n\\nA reduction in the ownership of cars has also shown a surprising improvement of psychological wellbeing. In Vauban, Germany, they have almost completely cut out automobile use in their community. \"\\'When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\\' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor\" Source 1, 3. It sounds like people can be much happier without the constant buzz of cars coming and going. The mention of children also makes me think that it would be a much safer environment to raise children without the stress of parents having to worry if their children would be safe with so many cars about. I think everyone remembers their parents telling them time and time again to look both ways before crossing, and then double check, and then hold their hand, and watch out for rightturning traffic. A reduction in automobile use, in this case, is directly related to the stress parents have over their children when doing something so simple as crossing the street.\\n\\nIn addition, a reduction in automobile use and ownership gives the local Government something more beneficial to focus on, rather than spending millions on repaving roads \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\" Source 3, 28. With this change, local Government can focus on really improving the standard of living more job openings with more buisinesses, easier travel despite what one might think during rushhour, and a higher level of general safety with less danger of car accidents.\\n\\nAll in all, I think it will be a hard transition to go through if Government does plan to get involved in the reduction of car usage. It\\'s easy to make bad habits, but it\\'s hard to break them. However, if we do succeed, we will see a huge improvement on the environment and the standard of living, and it will be really worth it. These are not views or opinions these are facts.Limiting car usage is a step towards addressing various social and environmental challenges, such as air pollution, traffic congestion, energy consumption, and even certain health concerns related to sedentary lifestyle. It is indeed necessary for us to understand the advantages of limiting car usage as highlighted in multiple passages studied.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, limiting car usage significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. In the passage by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it is emphasized that passenger cars account for \"12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\" and \"up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\" (Rosenthal, 2009). Reducing these emissions, as we see in Vauban, Germany, leads to cleaner air and lower levels of smog. Similar reports come out of Paris, where a partial driving ban resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and smog levels (Duffer, 2014). \\n\\nFurthermore, restricting the use of personal vehicles creates a more people-friendly urban environment, leading to higher quality of life and potentially boosting physical activity. Vauban\\'s verdant streets were marked by the noise of \"bicycles and the chatter of wandering children,\" not the humdrum of motors (Rosenthal, 2009). Similarly, during a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, millions of people chose alternative, and often more active, modes of transport such as walking, biking, or skating, hence reducing smog and promoting healthier lifestyle (Selsky, 2002). \\n\\nLimiting car usage also seems to align with the behaviour of younger generations, who appear less reliant on personal automobiles. It\\'s suggested that rates of car ownership have started falling, especially amongst younger people, and there has been a concurrent rise in the use of public transportation, cycling, and walking (Rosenthal, 2013). \\n\\nInterestingly, this change in behavior might not stem from environmental motives alone, but also from the influence of technology, shifts toward urban living, and, perhaps, a lessening cultural fixation on automobiles (Rosenthal, 2013). Significantly, this trend has not disrupted the transportation industry but instead prompted it to conceptualize \"cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network\" (Rosenthal, 2013).\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage is far from a purely restrictive measure. By lowering greenhouse emissions and pollution, promoting a shift towards healthier means of transportation, and fostering more pedestrian-friendly spaces, we stand to improve our quality of life and our environment. Meanwhile, trends suggest that such changes are not only feasible, but they could also represent our transportation future. Indeed, the transformation of our car culture could be one of the most dynamic and beneficent aspects of contemporary urban development.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. One major advantage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting the number of cars on the road, communities can contribute to reducing these emissions and combatting climate change.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage about the driving ban in Paris due to smog highlights how car emissions can contribute to poor air quality. By reducing the number of cars on the road, communities can experience cleaner and healthier air. This can have both immediate and long-term benefits for public health, as well as reduce the occurrence of respiratory problems and other health issues related to pollution.\\n\\nIn addition, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, demonstrates how removing cars from the streets can result in less traffic and more efficient transportation. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as biking, walking, and public transit, communities can reduce the number of cars on the road and improve overall traffic flow.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for more sustainable and compact communities. The passage on the German suburb of Vauban illustrates how designing communities to be less car-dependent can create a more environmentally friendly and livable environment. By placing stores within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation, communities can become more accessible and promote a sense of community engagement.\\n\\nMoreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage mentions how car ownership in Vauban is limited, with 70% of families not owning cars. This can result in cost savings for individuals who no longer have to bear the expenses associated with car ownership, such as gas, maintenance, and parking. Additionally, communities can free up space previously allocated to parking lots and garages, which can be repurposed for other uses such as parks or community spaces.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, alleviation of traffic congestion, creation of more sustainable communities, and economic benefits. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and designing communities with less dependence on cars, individuals and communities can contribute to a more sustainable and livable future.If someone wishes to travel somewhere, such as a normal commute, probably the first transportation method they think of is a car. Cars are everywhere. They\\'re the things hiding in a home, waiting for someone to enter the depths of the dark garage. Unless the garage is truly empty of the worldkilling machine, such as in Vauban, Germany where people have done the unthinkable: got rid off cars.\\n\\nThough it may sound preposterous, or even critically insane to even consider giving up a car, the citizens of Vauban are a lot happier to be rid of the burden. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\" Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars. As you may have forgotten, car payments, maintenance, check up, oil changes, and gas are all part of owning a car which may be a financial strain for most.\\n\\nAgain, those robots that you move with pedals and a steering wheel are seriously affecting our Earth. We\\'re Earth murderers. \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States\" Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars. Fellow humans, we are not the only species on planet Earth. We are so used to cars it\\'s like watching something interesting on TV and trying to pull away from it it\\'s nearly impossible. \"After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clean the air of the global city\" Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog. Less driving cars is less greenhouse gasses that destroy our Earth.\\n\\nIn our society today, cars are the dominant transportation method. When you go outside in today\\'s world it is most likely not the sound of nature, but a manmade vehicle. Without cars, a whole new world will come forth, or most likely the beautiful world we forgot about that is mercilessly trapped beneath unessesary layers of greenhouse gases. When Paris banned cars, it improved the pollution stuck in the air. \"The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French part to recind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday\" Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog. If we stop driving cars, it will help most people financially, help our Earth, and ease the worry and stress over the maintenance of a car. Once again, we are not the only species on Earth.The presidential Elections.\\n\\nThe elections are a brutal time candidates compete for the favor of the citizens they campaign, give great speeches about why they would be best for the position of leading the nation, often state why their adversary would be the worst person for the job. This causes opposition in the nation tearing it apart, however now not only are the people emotional about the election but also about the process, their are aguments about whether or not that the original process would remain. The system that the elections have been held since the Constitution has been written was that each citizen in a state would vote for one candidate or the other by voting for the electors of that specific person then the electors in turn would vote for the candidate and their votes would decide the presidency as stated in paragraph six and seven of the first source\" What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register. This system although it has worked so far it is not the best way of conducting the elections in this time and age citizens should modify and conform the process to fit the need we have now.\\n\\nThe problems claimed by the ones poised to the electoral college, as told in the second source \" The Idefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer, are that the process cause individuals to have little to no say in the person that will be their leader for years, they do not have control over who their candidates elect and must simply hope that they do indeed vote for who they promised to, also the election is decided by the few states that do not have a predetermined majority of voters in each state leaving the rest of the country feeling left out of the fiasco of the election and as if their perfered candidate dose not care of them or their support and opinions. This presents the system to be truly flawed in the way that it is currently operating.\\n\\nIndividuals,as source three \"In Defense of the electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner, wish to claim that the system is not flawed in great lengths because it has worked for such a time that it is seen by them sufficient in its orcastration. It is said that the electors often do vote for who they pleaged they would and that decite is uncommon: however why should America risk the possibility of decite it has happened befor and if not prevented it will happen again. Do we not owe it to ourselves, posterity, and country to fix all potental harms to our nation the presidency should not be taken lightly it is a grand position that gives power and fame to all who hold those who have it could maintain the country, grace the nation with new prosperity, or condem Americans to years of suffering, toil, and misery. As citizens we should not alow anyone but the most valid character obtain this place. Mistakes are not alowed! we should take it upon ourselves now to modify this method be for it is to late and avertid.\\n\\nThere is no mitake America must act fast and modify this method for the nation, for their children, and for themselves.Dear, Senator There are many ways in keeping the change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States instead of keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a difficult process to go through. The Electoral College consists of the electors, where they vote for the President and the Vice President and also the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Electoral College is unfair, outdated to the voters, by using the election by popular votes for the president of the United States is fair to voters because they get to choose the person to run the office for four years.\\n\\nTo begin with, in favor keeping the change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States is very helpful for the voters to vote easily to choose and listen to the candidates to see who will be great to the world. In source 3: \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner in paragraph 20 states, \"Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decided the election\". What this quote is trying to say that letting the voters choose and listen to the candidates very carefully to decide on the election, who will be helpful. Letting voters vote are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average and that they will received the most information and attention from the candidates. By arguing keeping the popular votes for the president of the united States is very fair to the voters.\\n\\nFurthermore, the people such as the voters help choose the state\\'s electors when you are voting for the President. For example, in source 1: \"What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the federal Register in paragraph 6 say, \"You help choose your state\\'s electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate\\'s electors.\" This quote explains that the voters get to choose the President but it\\'s actually voting for the candidate\\'s electors. It\\'s more easier keeping the popular vote for the president of Unites States instead of keeping the Electoral College because its a difficult process to go through.\\n\\nIts true that election by popular vote for the president of United States is a good argument for the voters to choose wisley. As this can be seen as in source 2: \"The Indfensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer in paragraph 9 states, \"This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.\" For example, in the 2000 U.S presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election by receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore\\'s 226. By keeping the popular vote for the President of the United States is more easier for the society instead of using the Electoral College.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, why keep the Electoral College, when you can you use the popular vote.\\n\\nSo by keeping the popular votes is useful to let these people vote on who they want to choose. So by other people perspective, you should keep the popular votes.\\n\\nSincerly, anonymous, hopefully your satisfied.The automobile is a production commonly used by individuals all over the world. But utilization of this transportation vehicle arouses environmental damage as well as stress. Limiting car usage around the world would be greatly beneficial.\\n\\nLimiting automobile usage would decrease hazardous rates of air pollution in regions at which cars are commonly driven. The tailpipe of cars release toxins, often produced by the automobiles fuel, that severely pollute the environment once in the air. According to experts, \"passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50%...in the United States\"Source 1. This amplifies the dangerous impact automobiles have on the environment. Paris, a carusing country, reached extreme levels of smog due to automobile emissions. According to Reuters, \"Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic matter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London\"Source 2. Due to this, a ban was made on car usage and the smog eventually cleared. automobiles emissions of greenhouse gases are utterly harmful for the environment.\\n\\nDecreasing the utilization of automobiles would also ease stress levels among the community. In Vauban, Germany, cars are practically forbidden causing the suburbs streets to be free of the persistent humming of a motor. \"When I had a car I was actually tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\"Source 1 says Heidrun Walter, a citizen of the carfree city. This illustrates how the loss of automobiles can bring tranquility to a region. Bogota, Columbia hosts the Day Without Cars, a day where the driving of an automobile is not permitted. According to Andrew Selsky, due to this occasion, \"pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks\" and \"rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic\"Source 3. Lowering the usage of automobiles would relieve individuals of density caused by driving.\\n\\nAutomobiles are an exemplary form of transportation but their impact isn\\'t as beneficial for other purposes. Car emissions of greenhouse gases promote global warming and traffic only tenses drivers. Limiting the utilization of these vehicles would decrease if not diminish their negative impacts on the world.Limiting car usage can have significant advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This is evident in various case studies and studies conducted in different parts of the world. By reducing car usage, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, enhance public health, and foster a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.\\n\\nOne significant advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a leading cause of climate change. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. By using cars less frequently, individuals can contribute to reducing these emissions and helping mitigate climate change.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality. The passage about Paris\\' driving ban due to smog illustrates this point. The smog in Paris rivaled that of Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. By implementing car-free days and limiting car usage, cities can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for their residents.\\n\\nFurthermore, reducing car usage can have positive effects on public health. The passage about the German suburb of Vauban highlights this benefit. In Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden, 70 percent of families do not own cars. Residents report feeling less stressed and happier without cars. This is supported by studies that have shown the negative impact of traffic congestion and long commutes on mental health. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transport, people can lead healthier and more active lifestyles.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of sustainable and efficient transportation systems. The passage on the Colombian car-free day demonstrates this. In Bogota, millions of Colombians left their cars at home and used alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, skating, or taking buses. This not only reduces congestion and traffic jams but also encourages the development of infrastructure to support these alternative modes of transportation. This can include the construction of bike lanes, better sidewalks, and improved public transport systems, making cities more accessible and livable for everyone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage can have significant advantages. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, enhance public health, and promote sustainable and efficient transportation systems. The case studies and studies discussed in the passages provide evidence of these benefits. It is crucial for individuals and society as a whole to consider the advantages of limiting car usage and actively work towards implementing measures to achieve these benefits.Imagine getting off work on a Friday at five o\\'clock, there\\'s no bumper to bumper traffic, no horns honking at each other, and no stressful commutes home. This is unimaginable for people who reside in the U.S., but people in parts of Europe live like that every day. There are many advantages to cutting down on car usage.\\n\\nOne advantage to this cut would be that you would be saving money. Many people who drive tend to get in accidents or get pulled over by police for speeding. These incidents are very costly and come with repercussions if you don\\'t pay them. Another way you would be saving money is not having to pay for gas. Gas may be only 2.00 for now, but when those prices go on that incline again it becomes very costly to fill up the tank. If you can\\'t afford to fill up your tank then you will be putting wear and tear on the car which leads to more more money being spent to maintenance it. Alternate transportation that\\'s more cost efficient is taking the city bus. It costs about 1 to get from point A to point B where it would cost you about 6 in gas to get you to the same place. You could also purchase a bicycle to take you where you need to go. Maintnancing a bike is a lot cheaper than a car.\\n\\nA second advantage that limiting car usage has is that it eliminates pollution. A car gives off sound, light, and air pollution which all effect our ecosystem whether you notice it or not. The U.S may not have as much air pollution as other countries but with the increase in car purchases it could get worse. I\\'m not saying youn have to completely get rid of your vehicles, but maybe the license plate bill may work. Every other day only license plates that begin or end with odd numbers could drive, and on the days the odds can\\'t drive we allow the plates with the even numbers to drive. People could car pool with coworkers on the days that whoever has those plates can drive. We just need to start taking percausions on our car usage.\\n\\nIn the car free test cities people are overall happier because they aren\\'t so stressed worrying about being late due to traffic or getting in an accident. Driving can be extremely stressful especially with the many things that can distract people so easily. These distractions can lead to accidents or just more stress. \" when I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\\' said Heidrun Walter, mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children driwn out the distant motor.\"Source 1, Paragraph 3, Lines 411 This quote puts an image in my mind that is happy and stress free. Imagine how happy you would be if everything was conviently close to youer home and you could enjoy walks or biek rides places with your kids.\\n\\nPeople should take a moment and think about ehat life without depending on cars would be like. Would you be healthier, happier, or not? Just take into consideration how you would live and be if we didn\\'t have to rely on cars.For many years, the automobile has become and remained a staple in the world as humanity\\'s most popular choice of transportation. The number of cars manufactured by car companies has reached the hundreds of millions. Cars have been a trademark of American ingenuity and the evolution of technology. However, as we go into the great beyond that is the future, we must take into consideration the pains and risks of these vehicles, and if they are worth driving as the world population exceeds seven billion.\\n\\nFew people can recall a time where global warming wasn\\'t the main conflict of scientists today. The Earth gets warmer as pollution levels rise as smog around cities like Paris and Mexico City reaches an all time high. The polar caps are melting at a rapid rate as hurricanes ravage the mainland harder and harder each year. What caused this stuff to happen? Why, look no further than our friends, the factories and automobiles! These two have been quoted time and time again as the catalyst of the global warming crisis. With such an adverse effect on the ozone layer, governments around the world have to do something to stop it from rising any further, with nothing short of success. Places like France have realized the extreme rise in smog levels in the city of Paris, that they had to do something. So, they made a ban on driving for people with even numbered license plates with only a few exceptions, and banned odd numbered licensed cars the next to try to curtail this occurrence. After a few days, it worked. The smog cleared just enough for the French government to rescind its ban on license plates for the city. Such a huge difference in smog in only two days means that making a ban similar to this could be nothing short of beneficial for communities around the globe. So why don\\'t more communities take up the hard task of making this ban a regular happening? It\\'s a slow process, but it is happening, in unlikely places. Including over in our Western European ally Germany.\\n\\nVauban, Germany is a small community town located near the border of France and Switzerland. This town is best known for it\\'s extremely unorthodox method of removing greenhouse gases from the ozone layer. People have decided to give up their cars, just relying on other transportation like walking and taking a local tram. Street parking, driveways and home garages are just not allowed in the district, and this has caused a huge difference between noncar owners and car owners alike. Seventy percent of the population in Vauban does not own a motor vehicle, a large portion of them sold their cars to move out to this small, cozy little town. Busy sidewalks and the chatter of civilians outshines the faint murmurs of the few odd automobiles in the city. What started out as an odd social experiment has turned into a great community full of happy people. Although this type of community is generally unpopular, other countries around the world have come to like the idea Vauban came up with. The capital city of Colobia, Bogota, has a neat program they like to call the Day Without Cars. The title speaks for itself. Civilians would take one day out of the year to generally not use cars, to promote the likening of taking other modes of transportation to wherever you need to go. Countries in South America have noticed this day, and are looking to replicate it themselves, which ultimately signifies the success of the Day Without Cars.\\n\\nCountries around the world have all tried to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, whether by making a community built around the nonuse of cars, making a day celebrating the use of other modes of transportation, or just banning the driving of automobiles outright. As just of a cause it may be, Americans are still hesitant to enact such henious laws. However, if more communities are built around this clean idea, more and more people will flock to it. It just takes preserverence, a strong plan, and a whole lot of sidewalks.Dear state senator, I think that we should change to start voting by popular vote because it will be easier for the voters and is a more realistic way of voting.\\n\\nWhen voting and following the rules of the electoral college, many voters get confused. As is says in source 2, many voters vote for the wrong person. They also don\\'t always get control over who they vote for. Say they voted for one candidate to be their state senator, well with that one person comes many people that have \"pledged\" themselves to that candidate. They would be voting for the candidate and these many people that have pledged themselves to him and they don\\'t even know it.\\n\\nAlso as they say in source 2, the election of 2000 was a huge mishap in presidential election history. In states like Louisiana, they had people replace democratic electors so that the popular vote that would\\'ve went to one of the candidates, didn\\'t actually go through. Although the electoral college is good for getting exact numbers and helps solve disputes source 3it is an uruly and untrustworthy way of voting and should not be used anymore. Voters are easily confused when voting and many do not follow up on what is happening during election time. I think that a better way to vote would be to vote more often and give the electors another chance to be relected so that after a few months if voters changed their mind then they could reelect someone else.\\n\\nPopular vote is a much better idea not only becuase it is more realistic, but because it is easier to understand. Even some of our presidents like Richard Nixon and Bob Dole have thought that this was the way to go. Not only do they believe this, but they lost their presidency votes becuase of the electoral college. I think that they are just trying to scam voters and pick someone that would be best for them, not for our country. I think that by using the electoral college method, they are cheating into picking the winners, but if we used popular vote, this wouldnt happen.\\n\\nThank you for your time.Senator [LastName],\\n\\nI hope this finds you well. I write to you as a concerned constituent about an issue that defines our democracy: the institution of the Electoral College. While the system has been criticized as undemocratic and outdated, I argue that it still holds significant relevance in preserving fairness and stability in presidential elections.\\n\\nThe Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and by a popular vote (Passage 1). Not just a place, but an intricate process involving the selection of electors, their voting for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\\n\\nOpponents of the Electoral College point to the possibility of the popular vote winner losing the presidency due to an imbalance of electoral votes (Passage 9). Indeed, there have been instances where this has happened, two times since 1888, to be precise (Passage 16). However, these cases are extremely rare and should not be the basis for dismantling a centuries-old system. \\n\\nJudge Richard A. Posner, in his article \"In Defense of the Electoral College,\" outlines several practical reasons for its preservation. Posner points to the system\\'s tendency to provide a \"Certainty of Outcome\" as one of its key benefits (Passage 17). The Electoral College invariably delivers clear outcomes by awarding a majority of its votes to the winning candidate (Passage 18). The winner-take-all system ensures a definite result, whereas a direct popular vote might be riddled with disputes and recount requests.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College forces presidential candidates to broaden their appeal beyond regional boundaries (Passage 19). The necessity of securing electoral votes in various regions prevents a candidate from winning through concentrated regional popularity, thereby encouraging a nation-wide campaign promoting unity and cohesion. This system also directs candidates\\' focus onto swing states where voters are likely to pay close attention to the campaign, ensuring the most thoughtful voters decide the election (Passage 20).\\n\\nWhile it is true that the system tends to favor larger states, this can be viewed as a reset of the political balance that large states lose because of the Senate\\'s mal-apportionment, as Posner argues (Passage 21). The inevitability of a clear outcome helps to avoid run-off elections, simplifying the electoral process (Passage 22).\\n\\nSome criticisms of the Electoral College are valid, such as with respect to its potential to discourage voters in states dominated by the opposite political affiliation. However, I believe we could remedy this through reforms such as those adopted by Maine and Nebraska which have a \"proportional representation\" system, rather than entirely uprooting the Electoral College.\\n\\nI urge you to consider the arguments presented while contemplating reforms in our election process. While the electoral college may indeed seem antiquated in some regards, it remains critical to maintaining a unified, nation-wide focus in our Presidential elections.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing your viewpoint on this matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your Name][Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my position on the matter of the Electoral College and its role in the selection of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information provided in the texts, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College for several key reasons.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College was established as a compromise between electing the President through a vote in Congress and electing the President through a popular vote. It ensures that both the states and the citizens have a say in the selection process. As stated in the text by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. This system ensures that candidates must appeal to a broad range of states and regions rather than solely relying on dense population centers.\\n\\nOne of the benefits of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. This is because the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains in his defense of the Electoral College, the winner-take-all system in most states creates a landslide electoral-vote victory even with a slight plurality in a single state. This certainty of outcome is crucial in preventing disputes over the popular vote count and ensuring a smooth transition of power.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College fosters the concept of \"everyone\\'s president.\" As Judge Posner states, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, thus requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This encourages candidates to campaign across the country and consider the interests of all regions. It helps prevent the feeling of disenfranchisement among citizens from states that have lower populations or less political influence.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to focus on swing states, as mentioned by Judge Posner. Swing states often hold the decisive votes in elections and receive greater attention from candidates. This gives voters in these states the opportunity to make informed decisions, as they are more likely to receive extensive campaigning and information from the candidates. The electoral system incentivizes candidates to engage with voters in all states, ensuring a more balanced representation of the nation\\'s interests.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also addresses the issue of large states potentially dominating the election process. As Judge Posner argues, the Electoral College balances the political weight between large and small states. The popular vote in large states like Florida would have a significant impact on the outcome, while smaller states like Wyoming still maintain their influence. This balance helps prevent marginalization and allows for the inclusion of diverse perspectives in the presidential election.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which occur when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This reduces the complexity and potential for confusion in the election process. The Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges, minimizing the need for additional rounds of voting and maintaining the efficiency and stability of the electoral system.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College system serves as a necessary compromise that upholds the principles of fairness, regional representation, and certainty of outcome. It prevents the domination of densely populated areas, encourages trans-regional appeal, and balances the interests of large and small states. While not perfect, it has proven to be an effective system for over two centuries. I urge you to consider these factors when evaluating any proposed changes to our presidential election process.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Although limiting car usage may seem out of the ordinary, it has many benefits that appeal to people. By limiting car usage, people save money, the air isn\\'t being poluted as much and there aren\\'t as many traffic jams.\\n\\nFor starters, not having or using a vehicle is a huge money saver. For example, a German suburb, Freiburg, near French and Swiss borders allow the use of cars, but is somewhat strict. Rosenthal states, \"Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home.\" Not only does it cost 40,000 just for that but gas and fixups go along with having a car.\\n\\nSecondly, the less people use vehicles, the less air pollution is going to be created. For instance, Paris issued a driving ban in an effort to \"clear the air of the global city.\" Duffer says, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...\" The smog that affects Paris is also known to \"rival\" with Bejing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. By banning car usage for a day, the air had a chance to breathe and is overall healthier for the people that live in that area.\\n\\nLastly, it\\'s obvious to say that with less car usage, the more likely it is to have a decrease in number of traffic jams. To further explain, Bogota, Columbia has a program in which people do not use vehicles to get where they need to go. Andrew Selsky states, \"...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.\" It\\'s a positive thing to have \"carfree day\" because less accidents mean less people getting injured.\\n\\nTo conclude, limiting car usage is not only good for people, but it can be positive toward the earth and environment as well because it saves people money, the air is healthier and people have less of a chance of crashing.The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and wide-ranging. Limiting car usage can have positive effects on the environment, public health, and the overall quality of life for citizens.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a leading cause of climate change. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can significantly reduce the amount of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere.\\n\\nIn addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on air quality. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights how car emissions can contribute to poor air quality, with levels of particulate matter in the air exceeding those in other European capitals. By limiting car usage, especially in densely populated areas, we can reduce air pollution and improve public health.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The passage mentions the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden and streets are designed to be car-free. This type of smart planning can create communities where amenities such as stores and public transportation are within walking distance, reducing the need for lengthy car trips. This not only makes it more convenient for residents to access necessities but also promotes physical activity and social interaction.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can also have economic benefits. The passage mentions how delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban, but exceptions were made for electric and hybrid vehicles. This indicates that promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as electric cars or bicycles, can support new industries and create job opportunities.\\n\\nFinally, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on overall quality of life. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota highlights how banning cars for a day can create a sense of community and reduce stress. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create more pedestrian-friendly streets, reduce traffic congestion, and create safer and more enjoyable public spaces.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, from reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more compact and accessible communities and improving overall quality of life. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning principles, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.For decades, society has put a major emphasis on transportation in order to center themselves around cars and ways to upgrade them. However, it is this frame of that mind that has created issues for modern society. If there were limitations put on the usage of cars, then those rules would help maintain the environment, save car owners money, and create a feeling of bliss and serenity that has disappeared since the mass production of cars. So unless change is brought upon society, then people will be passing up on benefits that would better the whole world.\\n\\nScientist have long realized that cars are a major cause to the pollution brought into society. From the waste produced while turning precious oil into gasoline, to the engines in millions of cars simultaneously burning gas. It is for this reason that limiting the use of cars would assist in saving and maintaining the environment. According to Robert Duffer, the author of the article \"Paris Bans Driving Due to Somg\", \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog.\" What is also noteworthy is that this experiment by France officials was only in place for a matter of days. So after having smog that repotedly rivaled Beijing, China, the smog capital of the world, the smog that inhabited France was more than cut in half. If this can work in such a large scale like France, then it isn\\'t unreasonable to believe that this same process can be done in other major regions. Saving the environment has become a priority around the world in recent years, and the idea of limiting the usage of cars could help to achieve that goal.\\n\\nAside from the fact that the limitation of cars can save the environment, it can also save car owners money. When a person stops at a gas station to fill up their car, they can expect to spend between twenty and fifty dollars. However, if cars were to become less relevant, then this money can be used to fund other important aspects of a persons life. While this might seem farfetched, according to Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, \"the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter.\" This analysis helps to justify the fact that cars can eventually become less relevant and thus save people money. Also, money would be saved on not having to repair and maintain a car, or having to buy a car in general. This alone can save a carowning household thousands of dollars each year.\\n\\nSaving the environment and money are always an obvious choice when explaining the benefits of limiting car usage, but another benefit would be obtaining bliss and serenity around the globe. Since the mass producion of cars, cities are always filled with the irritating sounds of a lively road. This has left many people to enjoy their walks, not to the sounds of children laughing and people conversing, but to the beeping and screeching of cars. However, in a city in Germany called Vauban, officials have successfully created a peaceful city that relies on walking and public transportation instead of cars. According to Heiden Walter, a media trainer and citizen in Vauban, \"When I had a car i was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" This quote goes to show that the citizens don\\'t feeled resticted, but released from their reliance on cars. So although it may seem difficult, putting limitations on cars can create a happier populants.\\n\\nPutting a limitation on the use of cars would not be a punishment like some would see it, but a way to better society. This limitation would help save and maintain the environment, save car owners money, and create bliss and serenity amongst people. As modern society continues to push forward and develop the next wave of advancements, putting limitations on the use of cars should be seen as a serious inquiry to leaders around the world.To whome this may concern the electoral college is out dated and unfair. Examples of this would be that bias can take up a big part of it. For example if an electoral does not like who is running for president on the winning side they can bend the votes into there favor. Another example would be in the case of a tie the election would be given to the house of representatives witch would be another unfair vote, because each representative stands for everyone in the state. So if the representative in MA was demcrait and the representative in TX was republican then the morty vote would most likely go to the republicans.\\n\\nOther examples of how unfair the system is the \"winner take all\" system. Reasons it is unfair is that the the running candidates don\\'t go to states if they no they are going to win or not. Some states don\\'t even get to see the adds for some candidates because that stat morty is either repubclain or democrat. That is unfair to the people that are in the opposite party in that state. Futher more the system is unfair to people in states where the morty is something different from the party they are in.\\n\\nLast but not least the system is out dated. The electoral college has been around since the constution was writen but since then it has gone down hill with the bias and morty votes. Examples of this can be found int the two parragraphs above as well as in this one. Another example why is out dated and unfair is the people most likely do not have a say in who they pick. a reason for this would be the bias the members of the electoral have to a candidate. The vote they cast has a grater power over ours and can sway the vote to there favor is they want to. More reasons would be how the electoral college has been around since the constution. although other systems from that time still seem to work this one does not and it will continue to fail until it just stops working altogether.\\n\\nIn concluestion the electoral college needs to be changed due to the bias in the system along with the unfairness of the system. Also the age of the system and the fact that it seems to keep failing,And not showing any signs that it will get better. Or help with elections in a fair and approiate way. Later on in other elections.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n\\nSubject: The Electoral College vs. Election by Popular Vote\\n\\nDear Senator [Last Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. My name is [Your Name], and I am a concerned citizen of [State]. I am writing to express my views on the debate surrounding the Electoral College and the possibility of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the information from various sources, including the texts \"What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer, and \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College for the following reasons.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Despite occasional disputes over the outcome, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system ensures a clear winner with a majority of electoral votes, minimizing the likelihood of protracted disputes. Although the popular vote winner may not always win the presidency, such instances have been scarce throughout history. The rarity of such occurrences suggests that the Electoral College generally reflects the will of the people and produces an undisputed outcome.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of \"everyone\\'s president.\" In an era of increasing regionalism, it is essential that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College forces candidates to campaign beyond their solid regional bases and appeals to voters from different regions. This ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation and not just a few concentrated areas. By preventing candidates with only regional appeal from becoming presidents, this system promotes unity and a balanced representation of diverse perspectives.\\n\\nMoreover, the focus on swing states in presidential campaigns, thanks to the winner-take-all method, ensures that voters in these states receive special attention. Swing states often play a crucial role in deciding the outcome of elections, leading to greater voter engagement and informed decision-making. By allocating campaign efforts to these states, the Electoral College encourages candidates to address issues that are important to swing state voters, resulting in a more thoughtful and well-informed electorate.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed by the Constitution, grants small states more influence in the political process than their population would suggest. The Electoral College further amplifies this balance by providing larger states with more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This ensures that the concerns and interests of both small and large states are heard and considered in the election process.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College allows for clear winners and avoids the need for run-off elections. In scenarios where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, run-off elections can significantly complicate the election process. The Electoral College, by design, leads to a clear winner who secures the majority of the electoral votes. This avoids the need for additional rounds of voting and ensures a swift, decisive outcome for the nation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be an effective and balanced system for electing the president of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes the concept of \"everyone\\'s president,\" encourages voter engagement in swing states, restores balance between large and small states, and avoids the complexities of run-off elections. While concerns about fairness and representation are valid, the Electoral College continues to be a necessary compromise that merits preservation.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to consider my views on this important matter. I trust that you will make an informed decision that upholds the best interests of our state and nation. I look forward to witnessing the positive outcomes that the Electoral College can continue to deliver in our democratic process.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly clear, as demonstrated by examples from around the world. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, has implemented a car-free policy, with only two places available for car parking. As a result, 70% of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their cars when they moved there. The residents of Vauban have found that giving up their cars has led to a decrease in stress and an overall increase in happiness. This trend is not limited to Germany; it is growing in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world.\\n\\nLimiting car usage is an essential step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By separating suburban life from the use of cars, communities like Vauban are able to drastically reduce emissions from tailpipes. This approach is known as \"smart planning\" and involves making suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, as well as reducing the space available for parking. By placing stores within walking distance on a main street, instead of in malls along highways, communities can encourage residents to rely less on cars for their everyday needs.\\n\\nEfforts to limit car usage are gaining traction in the United States as well. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting \"car reduced\" communities, and legislators are beginning to take action. It is expected that public transportation serving suburbs will play a much larger role in federal transportation bills in the coming years. In the past, the majority of funding has gone towards highways, but that is likely to change as the importance of reducing car usage becomes more widely recognized.\\n\\nOther cities around the world are also implementing car-free initiatives. Paris recently enforced a partial driving ban to combat smog, and the ban led to a 60% decrease in congestion. Bogota, Colombia has been hosting a car-free day for the past few years, which has gained popularity and drawn the attention of municipal authorities from other countries. These cities are discovering that limiting car usage not only improves air quality but also promotes alternative transportation options, reduces stress, and creates a more connected and vibrant community.\\n\\nThe decrease in driving and car ownership in the United States may indicate a fundamental shift in American behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This trend could have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is one of the largest sources of emissions in the country. While the decrease in driving can partly be attributed to the recession, researchers believe that there is something more fundamental going on. Factors such as the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of center cities, and the availability of car-pooling apps are all contributing to a cultural shift away from car dependence.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and impactful. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improving air quality and reducing stress, communities around the world are finding that embracing alternative transportation options and creating car-free spaces can lead to significant benefits. By reimagining suburbs and promoting the use of public transportation, walking, and biking, we can create more sustainable and vibrant communities for future generations.It is becoming increasingly evident that there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage in modern society. The passage set provides several examples of communities and cities that are taking steps to reduce dependence on cars, and the positive outcomes they have experienced. Limiting car usage not only proves to be beneficial for the environment but also for the overall well-being of individuals and communities.\\n\\nOne key advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can effectively decrease these emissions and work towards combating climate change. The passage on Paris\\'s driving ban due to smog highlights the positive impact of such measures. The ban resulted in a significant decrease in congestion and smog levels, improving the air quality and overall health of the city\\'s residents.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can reduce traffic congestion, making transportation more efficient. The passage on the car-free day in Bogota showcases how millions of Colombians embraced alternative modes of transportation, resulting in empty streets and reduced traffic jams. This not only saves time for commuters but also contributes to a more sustainable and accessible transportation system. By promoting alternatives such as walking, biking, and public transportation, cities can alleviate congestion, improve mobility, and enhance the overall quality of life for their residents.\\n\\nLimiting car usage also encourages a shift towards more sustainable and healthy modes of transportation. The passage on Vauban, Germany, demonstrates how individuals can adopt a car-free lifestyle and experience increased happiness and reduced stress levels. This is further supported by the passage on the decrease in car ownership and driving in the United States. The trend suggests a cultural shift towards prioritizing alternative transportation options, such as walking or using public transportation, which can have positive impacts on physical and mental health.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for urban planning to become more focused on the needs of residents rather than accommodating cars. By reducing the need for large parking areas, cities can prioritize creating community spaces, such as parks and pedestrian-friendly streets. This can enhance social interactions and create vibrant neighborhoods. The passage on Vauban\\'s approach to smart planning emphasizes the placement of stores within walking distance, promoting pedestrian activity and reducing the need for long car trips to access essential amenities.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and diverse. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, promoting sustainable and healthy transportation, and creating vibrant communities, limiting car usage proves to be a vital step in creating a more sustainable and livable future. It is essential for individuals, communities, and governments to embrace this concept and work towards implementing policies and initiatives that encourage alternative modes of transportation.Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit our communities and the environment. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and air pollution. Countries like Germany, France, and Colombia have implemented various strategies to limit car usage and have experienced positive outcomes. These initiatives range from car-free neighborhoods to car-free days, all aimed at promoting alternative modes of transportation and creating more sustainable communities.\\n\\nOne advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, or using public transportation, we can significantly reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.\\n\\nAnother advantage is the alleviation of traffic congestion. In cities like Paris, where driving bans were enforced during periods of intense smog, there was a significant decrease in congestion. In fact, congestion in the capital of France was reduced by 60 percent during the driving ban. This not only improves the flow of traffic but also reduces the time and frustration associated with commuting. With fewer cars on the road, people can travel more efficiently and safely.\\n\\nLimiting car usage also has positive effects on air quality. The use of diesel fuel, which is common in many countries, including France, has been linked to increased air pollution. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and reducing diesel usage, we can improve air quality and protect public health. In Bogota, Colombia, car-free days have been implemented to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. The success of this initiative has led to other Colombian cities joining in, indicating the potential for these events to inspire change in other countries as well.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and accessible communities. In Germany, the suburb of Vauban serves as a model for low-car suburban life. With car-free streets, residents have to rely on walking, cycling, or using public transportation to get around. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban\\'s families do not own cars, and 57 percent even sold their cars to move to this car-free community. This approach to urban planning allows for more compact communities, with amenities and services within walking distance, reducing the need for long car trips.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, improving air quality, and creating sustainable communities, we can create a better future for ourselves and future generations. Countries like Germany, France, and Colombia have already implemented strategies to limit car usage, and these initiatives serve as examples for other countries to follow. It is essential that we continue to explore and support measures that promote alternative modes of transportation and reduce our reliance on cars.For years, the United States has been mass producing and using cars. It may sound surprising, but America has already reached its peak when it comes to buying cars source 4. More and more people around the globe have begun to realize the benefits of using alternative means of transportation. Places such as Vauban, bogota, Paris, and even New York have implemented programs to encourage the limited use of cars. The idea of giving up such a comfort may sound tragic at first, but reducing car usage has many advantages.\\n\\nWe use cars everyday for pretty basic purposes. To get to work or school or to run errands are just a few examples. Now, imagine what would happen if a car were not available to you. It probably would not be the end of the world. You could catch a bus or ask for a ride from somebody. If you really needed to, you could even ride your bike or walk to wherever you needed to go. People in the past tended to fear using alternative transport, for varying reasons. Maybe friends or family are not willing to give rides. Maybe the sheer thought of walking a mile may seem terrifying or ridiculous. The most common reason is probably that having a car is just too covenant, it seems that there is no need for any other way of transportation! But life can and should be adjusted to fit into these sources of transport. In Vauban, Germany, for example, residents have given up their cars in favor of a life without them source 1. I just proves that contrary to popular belief, cars are actually not a necessity!\\n\\nCitizens in Vauban, Germany walk or ride bicycles when they need to go someplace source 1. It\\'s almost needless to say this, but they have a much healthier lifestyle than most carowners in the United States! They are not afraid of walking or riding a bike a bit to get where they need to. Not only are these people in better physical shape, but one mother, Heidrum Walter, tells us that when she had a car, she was always tense, but now that she has given it up, she seems happier source 1. Carlos Arturo Plaza, in bogota, Columbia, says that using his bike on their annual nocar day reduces his stress levels. There is a direct corrolation between physical activity and mental wellbeing. The more activity, the better you feel. By limitting car usage, we are also encouraging the physical exercise that comes in place of it, making us a happier, healthier community.\\n\\nMaybe the most important reason to reduce car usage is to protect our enviroment. By obtaining and burning fossil fuels, we are both running out of this resource and posing the threat of spills and air pollution to our environment. The gasoline we use to fill our cars certainly won\\'t last forever. It won\\'t even last for much longer at the rate we are burning it at. Also, spills can be devasting to the ecosystem it impacts, as we have seen in the past, for example the BP oil spill. Perhaps the biggest disadvantage to the gasoline we use to fill our cars is the air pollution it leaves behind. Transportation is the second leading source of emissions in the US, behind power plants source 4. Also, in Paris, the smog from automobiles got to be so bad that they set laws to ban cars on certain days source 2. Just by reducing car usage for a few days, the smog cleared tremendously. It wouldn\\'t be hard at all for each individual in this community to cut back on the amount of time they spend driving in their cars, if for no other reason than to keep our Earth clean.\\n\\nOver the years, we Americans have grown accustomed to relying on cars for our every need, but we can\\'t do that anymore. As a community, we need to open our eyes and see the changes happening around us. Cars are not a necessity. We don\\'t even need to completely get rid of them, but it is neccesary for us to cut back, for the sake of our health and our environment. It may take some getting used to, but I promise, it is more than possible. In the words of Bill Ford, we can soon move forward to a world where \"pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve saftey.\" source 4.Car usage is a major contributing factor to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. It is crucial for us to limit our car usage and find alternative transportation methods in order to reduce our impact on the environment. Multiple examples from around the world demonstrate the advantages of car-free or low-car suburban living.\\n\\nOne such example is the town of Vauban in Germany, where residents have given up their cars. Streets are completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. Car ownership is allowed, but parking is limited and expensive. As a result, 70% of Vauban\\'s families do not own cars. This has had a positive effect on the residents, who report feeling happier and less tense. This experiment in low-car suburban life has led to more compact communities and increased accessibility to public transportation.\\n\\nSimilarly, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution caused by cars. Motorists were ordered to leave their cars at home on certain days based on their license plate numbers. The ban led to a 60% decrease in congestion and an improvement in air quality. Exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying multiple passengers to encourage greener alternatives.\\n\\nThe concept of a car-free day has also gained popularity in cities like Bogota, Colombia. This day promotes alternative transportation methods such as hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses. Violators are fined to ensure compliance. The program has been successful in reducing traffic congestion and promoting a healthier environment. Other cities have even adopted this idea and implemented their own car-free days.\\n\\nThese examples show that limiting car usage has numerous advantages. Firstly, it helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Cars are a major contributor to these problems, and by finding alternative transportation methods, we can make significant progress in combatting climate change. Secondly, limiting car usage reduces congestion in cities, leading to less traffic and improved traffic flow. This ultimately saves time for commuters and reduces frustration. Finally, promoting alternative transportation methods not only benefits the environment but also encourages a more active and healthier lifestyle.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are clear advantages to limiting car usage. We can see from examples around the world that low-car or car-free living leads to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, reduced congestion, and a healthier lifestyle. It is important for us to adopt these ideas and find alternative transportation methods in order to create a more sustainable future.I believe that there are many advantages when it comes to limiting car usage. Using cars for transportation has been around for nearly a decade, starting with the very first car to run on gas ever made. Many believe that having a car makes life more convenient. But there are many more cons that justify the right to limit car usage.\\n\\nThe first advantage to limiting car usage would be the most obvious one, which is economical purposes. Buying a car usually means spending thousands of dollars all at once or having to pay a bill every month until the full price of the car is payed. This doesnot includethe price for gas or other needs the car could have. Things like oil changes, transmission failure, or even something as simple as a flat tire could cost well over a hundred dollars just to fix all depending on the situation. This is not even considering the chance that your car could just stop functioning and you would need to buy a new car, which would lead to the ugly circle of life you just went through with your old car.\\n\\nNot only is limiting car use good economically, but also environmentally friendly as well. study shown that cars and other vehicles like this are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. This could be very dangerous in a place where many people live.\\n\\nAnother advantage would be that if there are less cars, there would be less accidents as well. Many deaths that have been occurring over the pass year are all car related. Things like natural storms that destroy cars or drinking and driving could be prevented if car usage is limited. If car usage was limited, the death toll would definitely get smaller.\\n\\nOne last advantage limiting car usage would bring is the gift of excersise. Many believe a car is very convenient due to the fact that it can get you where you want to go in a small amount of time which, in fact, could be very useful for special occasions. However, when it comes to using a car limits to driving to a gas station 4 blocks away from where you live just for snacks, that\\'s when things get out of hand. If you want to get somewhere, there are other ways besides cars that are safe and healthy for you. You could ride a bike, or even walk to where you want to go and still get the excersise you wouldn\\'t get from using a car.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons why car usage should be limited. However, that does not mean i don\\'t beileve in the usage of cars. Cars are a advancement in technology for people to get to where they need to go without a hassle. A gift like that should not be taken advantage of. People can still use cars, but in moderation. And if we take the time to walk or ride a bike, you will be healthy, happy, and have a pocket full of money left over.I dont think that the electoral college should decide the president of the united states, i think that the overall vote of the americans should determine the president of the unites states. I have certain reasons, and a good explanation of why the popular vote matters way more than the electoral vote first is why would they even have a popular vote if there not gonna go by it? Also the popular vote has mostly everyone in the united states voting on it, the electoral vote has only a couple people, they are way outnumbered. And lastly its not fair at all to the american people.\\n\\nFirstly, why would you want the whole united states of america to vote on something if what they vote, and what they say isnt being heard. Whats the point of it? in my opinion what the people say how the president should be determined. If they want it any other way why would they not have changed it by now? no one really likes having to take time out of there day to go vote, if there votes arnt even going to be seen, or heard by people? whats the point of making them do that?\\n\\nSecondly, the united states has billions of people in it, and the electoral college only has a few people in it. You think thats very fair to anybody ??? everyone votes, results are in, you think you have a winner, then all of a sudden theres no winner, you know why? because of the electoral college!!! these extra people make the final decision and thats not right. If thats the case of it to me it seems like they have the answers, and no one can decide but them, so why even have a vote? its really pointless the author states that most states like the idea that the overall vote wins, theres only a couple that dont like this idea. So by rule they should just make it the popular vote wins the election, and thats who tthe president becomes. Why they havnt done it? I have no idea!\\n\\nAnd my final reason of why popular votes should just determine who wins is because they go out and vote and they feel like it doesnt matter. Because the electoral college decides then the united states gets really mad when they vote and the popular vote doesnt win! Of course they get mad, who wouldnt? there votes mean nothing at all. And they need to change this electoral college policy, more people want it gone thaen the people that dont. And thats mostly why america is usually never satisfied with the president of the unites states. Because of the fact that the united states didnt put them and the votes first, they put the electoral college ahead and thats not how it needs to be!!! They should make a vote for the united states saying that who wants to keep the electoral college and who doesnt! i bet that they will say that they want it gone. Because its already been voted out before so why will they keep something that no one is satisfied, or pleased with? Hopefully they will see this soon enough!!!\\n\\nIn conclusion, this electoral college stuff just needs to go, and the people need to be happy with there vote that they want, and they should be! they have been living in the state there whole life, if not most of it. And they want to make sure that someone they like, and know and trust will be there leader and wont let them down, and will change the problems that are in america. So go ahead and keep the electoral college even if barely any one likes it. Cause that doesnt make any sesnse!!!! the people need to vote on there counties leader not a few people for each state, and or place. its not right, and no one really likes it.Some might thing cars are essential to life, but other might think they don\\'t need them at all. Limiting car use is a good thing because it limits the amount of fog, it reduces traffic jams and crashes, and people seem to be more family oriented. i believe that limiting car usage is a very helpful thing and a great idea.\\n\\nWe all know how badly cars gases are are and that without those harmful gasses there wouldn\\'t be much fog. now imagine if this happened here in America. In Paris they band driving due to the near record pollution. They did this so they could have a day where the air would clear out and there wouldn\\'t be that much fog. Some might think this is an excellent idea, but some might say its a very lousiness idea. Limiting car usage actually helps because your limiting how much of those harmful gases you put in the air. They tried this for a certain amount of time in Paris and that do you know! The smog cleared up enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for driving your cars. Now this is just one of the many great things limiting car usage has on our planet.\\n\\nSomething else similar to what they did in Paris happened in Colombia. They limited the car usage for one day to free up some of the congestion that they had in the capital Bogota. This is also a great idea because people don\\'t have to worry about crash crashing, people getting ran over, or kids getting hit by cars. People don\\'t have to worry about a lot of harsh things, so they live a somewhat stress less life. In Bogota they are also making new parks for people because without cars you don\\'t need to drive to parks you can just walk. People when they walk tend to have conversations with the people around them so they tend to have a more social and all in all better lifestyle. This could also help in places like New York or other very congested cities. Without all those cars filling up the roads with all there horrible gases, New York would have a very clean breathable air. Another thing is that they wouldn\\'t have many traffic jams andor many people getting in car crashes.\\n\\nOne of the most important reasons why limiting car usage is an advantage is because people are more family oriented. Studies have shown that when people don\\'t have cars they fell like they don\\'t have and debts and fell somewhat free. This will make a person more loving and more interested in family time. Also people tend to walk more and carpool, so this causes them to car pool or walk in groups and they do all of that with their own family. In Germany the citizens say life without a car is great. One citizen said how his life was so tense when he had a car and now without a car he is mush happier. Also America the percentage of drives have gone down by a lot. This is because people are unemployed, they don\\'t have money to buy a car, or they simply don\\'t want to be tense and have a car.\\n\\nLimiting car usage is a great ting and i believe people should at least try to make it happen. It helps reunite family\\'s, clear the amount of fog, and it reduces car jams and accidents. Some people might think its not a very good idea but some might think it is. So people should at least try to see what happens.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in place for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue for a shift towards a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should be considered.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This minimizes the likelihood of disputed election results, as seen in the 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush. The Electoral College provides a clear and decisive path to victory, which is crucial for maintaining a stable democracy.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College promotes representation for all regions of the country. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must have trans-regional appeal to win the presidency. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on regions where they have the most support, ensuring that the president will have broad-based support and take into account the interests of all Americans. It also prevents candidates from ignoring states with smaller populations, as the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes gives even small states some weight in the election.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome of the election is less certain. This means that voters in these states, who are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, have a greater influence on the outcome of the election. It encourages candidates to engage with voters directly and tailor their policies to address the concerns of these swing states. By doing so, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, have a say in deciding the election.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states in the political process. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate may give smaller states more influence, the Electoral College ensures that large states receive more attention from presidential candidates. This means that candidates must consider the concerns and interests of both large and small states, maintaining a balance of power and preventing one group from dominating the decision-making process.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College avoids the complications of run-off elections. When no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, run-off elections may be necessary. The Electoral College reduces the likelihood of this scenario by invariably producing a clear winner. This streamlines the election process and allows for a smooth transition of power.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College system provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes regional representation, encourages campaigning in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there may be arguments in favor of a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College remains the best method for electing the President of the United States.\\n\\nThank you for considering my perspective on this issue. I trust that you will take into account the diverse viewpoints and interests of your constituents when making decisions that affect our democracy.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This can be seen in the experiences of various communities around the world that have adopted car-free living. For example, in Vauban, Germany, streets are completely car-free except for the main thoroughfare. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move to the community. The citizens of Vauban have discovered several advantages of limiting car usage.\\n\\nFirstly, limiting car usage promotes a healthier lifestyle. In Vauban, residents are finding that they are much happier and less stressed now that they no longer rely on cars. Walking and cycling have become the primary modes of transportation, leading to increased physical activity and improved overall fitness. Furthermore, the absence of cars on the streets has created a quieter and more peaceful atmosphere, allowing residents to enjoy the serenity of the community.\\n\\nSecondly, limiting car usage reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Automobiles are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can be as high as 50 percent. By limiting car usage, communities like Vauban are able to make a significant impact in reducing their carbon footprint and combating climate change.\\n\\nThirdly, limiting car usage encourages the development of more sustainable and accessible communities. In Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This smart planning approach makes it easier for residents to access daily necessities without relying on cars. Similarly, in other car-free communities like Bogota, Colombia, millions of people have hiked, biked, skated, or taken buses to work during car-free days. These initiatives promote alternative transportation methods and reduce traffic congestion, creating more livable and vibrant cities.\\n\\nFinally, the trend of limiting car usage is gaining momentum worldwide. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car-reduced communities, and there are expectations for public transportation to play a larger role in future transportation bills. Moreover, recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This shift in behavior can have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including promoting a healthier lifestyle, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating more sustainable communities, and improving overall quality of life. As more communities around the world adopt car-free living, it becomes evident that limiting car usage is not only beneficial for individuals but also for the environment. It is time for us to reconsider our dependence on cars and embrace alternative transportation methods for a brighter and more sustainable future.Here in America, with our \"broad expanses and suburban ideals\" Rosenthal, para. 3, the automobile is the way in which we move: it takes us to school, to the office, to our homes, to the homes of others, to distant, unexplored places. Entire buildings and businesses are dedicated to this wonderful invention. However, as American culture shifts and we focus less and less on the car itself, the advantages to limiting our use of this tool become increasingly evident: less polluted air, more costfriendly alternatives, and the bonding of whole communities. This turnaway from a carfocused society could certainly change the American perspective on the automobile industry as a whole.\\n\\nCars, despite some of their clear advantages, cannot provide the necessary advantage of lesspolluted air. Automobiles in the United States can produce up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in carintensive regions European passenger cars can produce up to 12 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Europe Rosenthal without cars, these greenhouse gas rates dramatically drop. One example of this is the temporary ban of driving a car in Paris due to recordbreaking smog levels. According to an article by Robert Duffer, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog,\" and that colder nighttime weather and warmer daytime weather caused the warmer air to \"trap car emissions.\" People from other countries also seem to be enthusiastic about limited car use and its effects. Carlos Arturo Plaza of Bogota, Colombia, who participated in his city\\'s 3rd annual Day Without Cars, says that \" \\'It\\'s a good opportunity to...lower air pollution \"Selsky. In our own country, as Americans buy less cars and register for less driver\\'s licenses, sociologists can conclude that \"it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants\" Rosenthal, para.6. A reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will allow cleaner air, which could eventually lead to healthier living standards across the globe, as well as healthier and more diverse ecosystems and biomes. With the limited use of cars, this could all be a possibility.\\n\\nNot only will this restriction of car use allow for less air pollution, it could also lead to producing more costfriendly methods of transportation. Cars and their accessories are often expensive to maintain and to purchase, so the creation of other ways to get around are a must to those who cannot afford such maintenance or purchases. In a passage by Andrew Selsky, he states that Bogota\\'s Day Without Cars has allowed for the \"construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths\", along with \"broad, smooth sidewalks\", to travel on. In the booming and populous city of New York, its bikesharing program and \"skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls\" Rosenthal allow the world to see the shift towards cheap yet affective alternatives to transportation. Michael Sivak, research professor at the University of Michigan\\'s Transportation Research Institute, has a son who uses Bay Area Rapid Transit, even though it often takes longer than driving, simply because it is cheaper and a car is simply \"not a priority\" Rosenthal. Alternative transportation is definitely on the rise as car usage becomes less and less of a trend.\\n\\nWhile all of these advantages to limited car use affect us all, the one that will most directly and immediately affect people is the bonding of whole communities. When car use is reduced, there is more opportunity for interaction with others, whether it be through modern technology such as the cellphone or social media, or through facetoface communication as seen in a good oldfashioned conversation between two people. Various factors, according to Mimi Sheller, professor at Drexel Unviersity, are accountable for this community bond: the Internet, which allows for connection with people without driving to meet them the \"renewal of center cities\" to draw in \"empty nesters\" Sheller, Rosenthal as well as carpooling apps and services. Vauban, an entirely carfree suburb in Germany, has adopted a nocar policy in an attempt to separate suburban life and automobile use, an asset in a new project known as \"smart planning.\" This separation allows its citizens to have more personal interaction, with its businesses being a short walk from their homes and less space to park a personal automobile. This compacted suburban example in distant Germany is also being adopted in some places in America as well, and it may eventually be the future of American suburb life. With these changes come more and more opportunity to delve a deeper connection with the citizens who live in your area.\\n\\nAmerica has long been pictured as \"one of the world\\'s prime car cultures\" Rosenthal. It\\'s the home of many famous and renowned automobiles, including the Ford Model T and Detroit, Michigan, where Chrysler automobiles are manufactured and exported all over the globe. However, as the United States evolves into a different sort of country, so does its focus on the car. Restricting use of the car offers up many advantages to its citizens: less greenhouse gas emissions, more costfriendly options to transportation, and the opportunity to bond with your community. As the American Dream continues to change, so will the way in which we move.As we enter a new era of environmental consciousness, the frequency of personal car usage has come under scrutiny, revealing several distinct advantages of reducing our dependence on automobiles. Various global communities have pioneered experiments in limiting car usage and their results underline the environmental, health, and lifestyle benefits associated with such measures.\\n\\nOne of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. The story of Vauban, Germany a suburban district where car usage is heavily restricted exhibits 70% of families do not own cars, leading to a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal). Cars are accountable for up to 50% of greenhouse emissions in car-intensive areas in the U.S. (Rosenthal), hence, limiting car usage can contribute substantially to the global efforts to curtail climate change.\\n\\nMany initiatives across the world have successfully shown that limiting car usage can lead to improved quality of life and general well-being of the citizens. In Bogotá, Colombia, millions of residents participated in a car-free day, utilizing other means of transportation such as biking, hiking, or public buses (Selsky). Residents enjoyed the quiet streets, devoid of normal traffic congestions and air quality was noticeably improved. Furthermore, in Vauban, a resident reported feeling less tense and generally happier without a car, derived from the relaxed atmosphere with quieter streets and fewer traffic concerns (Rosenthal).\\n\\nAside from environmental and lifestyle benefits, reducing car usage also paves the way for city planners to rethink suburban design. In the example of Vauban, authorities experimented with placing stores within walking distance of residences, limiting parking spaces and focusing on public transportation. This kind of “smart planning” can create compact, walkable and more sociable communities, enhancing the quality of urban life (Rosenthal).\\n\\nDecreasing car usage also encourages the development of alternative modes of transport. Promoting biking, walking and public transit not only reduces emissions but can also have health benefits, such as increased physical activity. Events like the \\'Day Without Cars\\' in Bogota played contributed to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, a factor greatly promoting healthier living (Selsky).\\n\\nLimiting car usage can understandably appear inconvenient at first glance, particularly in regions where society has evolved around the presence of personal vehicles. However, a cultural shift appears to be in progress. In the U.S. the number of miles driven per person, as well as car ownership rates are declining (Rosenthal). Changes in lifestyle, facilitated by technology and evolving social attitudes, are making the prospect of car reduction an increasingly feasible endeavor. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as “mobility” companies, considering alternatives to private vehicles (Rosenthal).\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage presents several advantages. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improving quality of life through smart urban planning, and promoting a healthier, more active lifestyle, cities that reduce their dependence on cars stand to benefit enormously. These advantages suggest these efforts are not just about making our cities more sustainable, but also about creating a more enjoyable living environment.Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nIntroduction:\\nCar usage has long been associated with middle-class suburban life, but recent trends and initiatives are challenging this notion. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia demonstrate the advantages of limiting car usage. By adopting smart planning techniques, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, these communities are not only contributing to environmental sustainability but also improving the quality of life for their residents.\\n\\nBody Paragraph 1:\\nOne of the advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the articles, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By implementing car-free zones, like the ones in Vauban and Paris, these communities are actively combating air pollution. The success of these measures is evident in the significant decrease in congestion and smog levels. For example, Paris experienced a 60 percent reduction in congestion after enforcing a driving ban due to smog.\\n\\nBody Paragraph 2:\\nAnother benefit of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative modes of transportation. Vauban, for instance, has embraced a low-car suburban lifestyle, where 70 percent of families do not own cars. Residents of this community rely on public transportation and bicycles to commute, which not only reduces their carbon footprint but also improves their overall well-being. Car-free days, like the one in Bogota, are becoming more popular worldwide, encouraging millions of people to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work instead of driving. These events play a crucial role in shifting people\\'s behavior towards more sustainable transportation options.\\n\\nBody Paragraph 3:\\nIn addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to the creation of more compact and accessible communities. By placing stores within walking distance and reducing space for parking, suburbs can become less dependent on cars. This approach not only reduces traffic congestion and allows for a more efficient use of space but also fosters a sense of community. In Vauban, the absence of cars has resulted in verdant streets where people can freely walk and children can play without the constant noise and pollution associated with vehicular traffic.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly apparent in various communities worldwide. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, promotion of alternative transportation, and creation of more compact and accessible neighborhoods are all contributing to a more sustainable and fulfilling way of life. As more people embrace these initiatives, the car culture that has dominated suburban areas for decades may soon be a thing of the past. By prioritizing the environment and prioritizing the community, we can create a future that is not dependent on cars and is focused on the well-being of its residents.Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Lessons from Global Initiatives\\n\\nEver since the advent of cars, they have deeply ingrained themselves in our society, particularly in suburbs, as seen from the massive presence of parking spaces, driveways, and roads designed primarily for automobiles. However, this trend is gradually altering as the world wakes up to the various benefits of limiting car usage, both at an individual and city-wide level.\\n\\nVauban, a German suburb, provides an exemplar of reducing auto-dependence. Here, most families do not own cars, and the streets are designed primarily for pedestrians and cyclists (Rosenthal, \"In German Suburb\"). This lifestyle change has led to the emergence of a community where residents report increased happiness, demonstrating that a reduced reliance on cars can lead to improved mental well-being.\\n\\nHowever, the benefits extend beyond individual contentment. One of the most sizable gains from limiting car usage is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. As Rosenthal states, automobiles, particularly in suburban regions, are a significant contributor to greenhouse gases, accounting for approximately 12% of such emissions in Europe and much higher in some car-intensive regions in the US (\"In German Suburb\"). This is supported by the experience in Paris where a partial driving ban led to a significant decrease in smog levels (Duffer, \"Paris bans\").\\n\\nMoreover, reduced car usage encourages innovation in urban planning and transportation. The trend of “smart planning” is gaining momentum globally, with towns designed to be compact, accessible by public transport, and having less space allocated for parking (\"In German Suburb\"). \\n\\nA significant example of this is the Day Without Cars event in Bogota, Colombia which seeks to promote alternative modes of transportation and reduced smog. The success of this event, now being considered by other countries, indicates the extent of global readiness to shift towards a less car-dependent model (Selsky, “Car-free day”).\\n\\nThe decrease in driving also reflects a possible cultural shift in Americans\\' attitudes towards car ownership and usage. It could potentially impact car manufacturing industries, forcing them to diversify and, in turn, foster more sustainable transportation solutions (Rosenthal, “The End”).\\n\\nWhile the prospect of a reduced reliance on cars might once have seemed uncertain, especially with the question mark on whether millennials will shift towards heavy car usage when they have families, companies like Ford are already initiating partnerships that incorporate a holistic transportation network that includes “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation” (\"The End\").\\n\\nIn conclusion, the move towards car limitation has vast implications, from improved mental well-being to substantial contributions towards climate change and the transformation of cities into sustainable, smartly planned spaces. This does not completely disregard cars\\' usefulness, but it surely pushes us to reevaluate our dependency on them, and instead consider striving for a balanced, diverse transportation network benefiting all, including the environment.Cars have been a necessity to us for as long as I can remember. Billions of people around the world use cars everyday. Without cars in our lives many people would be lost and not know what to do. Thinking of a world without cars isunreasonable to thepeople oftoday, but if theythought of all the good not driving everyday does for the world then it would probably be a different story.\\n\\nMany places are enforcingpeopleto go without there cars transporting themeveryday, which could be a good thing. Heidrun Walter a man in source 1 states, \"Seventy percent of vaughn\\'s families do not own cars, and fiftyseven percent sold a car to move here.\" By saying this he is showing how many people like living their lives without all the troubles cars can cause. People of this community dont have to worry about being ran over by cars or being stuck in traffic everyday. David Goldberg, another man in source 1 also states, \"All of our development since World War two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.\" In saying this he portraying thatwe need to focuson more important things andstopworryingabout cars, which hurt us more in the long run than they do helping us.\\n\\nVauban isn\\'t the only place that has enforced the rule of not using cars. Many other places have done so also.Robert Duffer states, \"After days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" By saying this the author is explaininghow the use of cars have dramatically polluted a city. Just think, if there were no cars, then there would be less pollution to worry about hurting all the city\\'s. It is not hard to ride a bike to the places you need or want to go. Instead of using cars everyday and hurting our environment, people should think of how much good they would be doing and money they would be saving by taking another type of transportation than just cars.\\n\\nBogota, Colombia has also taken the no car use into affect. They have used many other types of transportion such as hiking, biking, and even skating to there destination. Businessman Carlos Arturo from source 3 says, \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" He and many other citizens of this place agree with saving our environment and not using cars. Not using cars is less stressful because your not consistently worring about gas, the car breaking, or getting into an accident with another driver.\\n\\nJust imagine your life without using a car everday. Not usinga car isn\\'t thatbad and doesnt hurt you or the people around you as much as it does having one. Using a car everyday puts your life at risk, takes your money, and hurts the environment.Life without cars would be simpler and less stressful in our world today.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[State Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: The Electoral College: A System of Balance and Representation\\n\\nDear [State Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College is an essential part of our democratic process that ensures representation and protects the interests of all states.\\n\\nThe Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and election by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This system consists of the selection of electors, their meeting and voting for the President and Vice President, followed by the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. It is a carefully designed process that ensures a fair and balanced election.\\n\\nOne of the advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. While disputes over the final result can occur, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents lengthy debates and recounts that could potentially destabilize the nation. In addition, the winner-take-all system ensures a clear, decisive victory and minimizes the possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election of the President. Candidates must have trans-regional appeal and consider the interests of all states, rather than focusing solely on densely populated areas. This prevents the dominance of a few states over the entire election process, ensuring a more balanced representation.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This leads to increased campaign efforts and attention from the candidates, allowing voters in these states to make more informed decisions. Centralizing the election process through a popular vote would result in candidates concentrating their efforts on densely populated urban areas, ignoring the needs and concerns of the majority of the country.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College gives due weight to large states, addressing the malapportionment of the Senate described in the Constitution. The winner-take-all system means that candidates pay more attention to large states, as winning by a slight margin in a large state can secure a significant number of electoral votes. This ensures that the interests and concerns of these states are taken into account during the campaign and presidency.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This system produces a clear winner and avoids the complications and uncertainties that would arise from run-off elections. It maintains the stability and efficiency of our election process.\\n\\nWhile some argue that the Electoral College can discourage potential voters who live in states with political leanings opposite to their own, the voter turnout in presidential elections speaks for itself. Nearly half of the eligible American population participated in the 2012 election, indicating that people vote to express their political preferences, not with the belief that their vote alone will change the outcome.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College ensures fairness, balance, and representation in the election of the President of the United States. It prevents any single state or region from dominating the election process and ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns and interests of all states. I urge you to support the preservation of the Electoral College, a system that has proved its effectiveness for over two centuries.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages of the Electoral College and make a decision that upholds the principles of our democratic system.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Cars nowadays are a big part of our lifes, they take us to where we need to go and help us go to far away places. Even though cars are important in our lifes, there are lot of advantages to limited car usage. Some places such as VAUBAN, Germany have given up their cars. \"Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home.\" This results in less people owning or having cars and reducing green house gas emissions from tailpipe. \"passengers cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gases emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States\" source 1. Private ownership of cars are slowly choking our cities, if we limit our car usage little by little it may have a huge effect in our ecosystem.\\n\\nIn continuation, there have been situations where the air pollution got so bad that they had to ban driving so they could clear the air. For example in Paris, \"after days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city\"source 2. The drivers were fined a 22euro fine if they did not leave their cars at home. In the end the smog cleared and the French party recinded the ban for oddnumbered plates. This is one of the many examples that proves that just by having less cars driving around it eventually changes the way the atmosphere looks and cleans the atmosphere a little.\\n\\nSmog is a sign of high air pollution, it indicates that the air is not healthy and this can be harmful to our environment. \"It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.\" As indicated in the passagesource 3, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\", just one day without cars can reduce smog imagine if we go weeks without a huge number of cars driving around. This idea might sound crazy to some people but it has surprisingly helped the environment. This however is not the only advantage of reducing car usage. Some other advantages are that if we go to our jobs in a bike everyday or just go for a walk instead of a drive we are also being more productive and active, hence making us healthier.\\n\\nAlthough some people might find leaving their cars behind is a bad idea, studies have shown that people who do so gets used to the idea and find less reason to resume the habit of car commuting. For example instead of driving to the beach we should ride our bikes or take public busses to get there. Without cars we learn to appreciate the beauty of nature more and notice things about the place were we live that we have never seen before. I have came to notice that when you are driving you really dont notice things because you are to busy focusing on the road, but when u have a walk around your neighborhood or anywhere for that matter you see things you have never noticed before and you leaarn to appreciate nature more. The idea of leaving our cars behind is hard for some people, but if you think about the effect it will have on the environment it is worth it.\\n\\nIn conclusion, carfree cities might sound like a joke to some people but it is helping out in clensing our environment increasingly. As indicated in the passage, \"The End Of Car Culture\", \"If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of Americas emissions, just behind power plants.\" We are responsible for how our environment is going to look like in the future years, wouldnt it be better for it to look like a beautiful clear sunny day or a foggy grey fuss? Quiting a habit like driving is very hard but the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.Dear or. Senator, I believe that America should keep the Electoral College to elect the president of the United States. I believe this because the Electoral College makes a guaranteed outcome, it gives proper representation to big states, and the president has to have a transregional appeal.\\n\\nThe Electoral College has more of a certainty of outcome for an election. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes a very convincing number but only 51.3% of the popular vote not as convincing. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of a tie in the votes. Even though the Electoral College has 538 votes, which would make it possible for a tie, it is very unlikely that there is a tie in the Electoral College. For example, Richard Nixon in 1968 only received 43% of the popular votes, but won 301237 in the Electoral College. Bill Clinton in 1992 had only 43% of the popular vote, but also won 370168. The pressure of a runoff election is reduced with the Electoral College.\\n\\nThe Electoral College gives the big states more representation than the smaller states. For example, Florida has 29 Electoral votes, while a state like Maine only has 4. In 2012, the popular vote was really close in Florida, but Obama won and got 29 electoral votes. If the same thing happened in Maine, the winner would only receive 3 Electoral votes. If America used the popular vote to decide who won, the win by a few votes would mean almost nothing, and the big states would have the same representation as the small states.\\n\\nThe president can\\'t win the election by just winning one region of states. The Electoral College has made it that the candidate would have to have a transregional appeal. This is desirable for most people because a president that is only popular in one region, and not everywhere will not be a good president. This is why candidates don\\'t campaign in places that they know they will win, and branch out to the swing states. These swing states basically decide the election. They are the states that do not favor either the democratic or republican candidate, so they have important votes. If swing states go one way, so will the election. This is why many candidates campaign in these Swing States.\\n\\nAs you can see or. Senator, the Electoral College is the best way to go for electing a new president. It has a more certain and guaranteed outcome than the popular vote, it gives more representation to the bigger states, and requires appeal from people all over America, not just people in one region.Whether if it\\'s a law in a country, the source of pollution or the cause of deaths, the usage of cars have its disadvantages and have been limited. However, driving cars have its advantages when individuals limit the use of it.\\n\\nUsing cars to reach a destination causes pollution according to experts, who are correct. According to paragraph 5, \"experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions tailpipe...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.\" Because of this there has been efforts in the past two decades to make cities safer and easier to breathe in. A city that faces these pollution problems is Paris, which made authorities to prohibit driving. \"After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" This is the right thing to do because after this law was implemented there was less congestion. \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog.\" Pollution also has more of an impact depending on the temperature and day. \"Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layers of air to trap car emissions.\" Also there are cities where using cars are near impossible, because of the laws that the governmental officials had enforced. An example of a city with these laws is Vauban, Germany. \"Street Parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. vaughn\\'s streets are completely carfree.\"\\' However, There are advantages when individuals drive less. Owners of the public transportation have taken action. They subliminally convinced drivers to reduce pollution and dangerous accidental by offering free transportation. \"Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday.\" When this was taken into action, smog was cleared in cities. \"The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday.\" When individuals drive less they are exposed to new activities that they have never experienced when driving. People can experience activities in places such as in Bogota, Colombia. \"In a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.\" The main goal for this was to advocate other transportation in order to reduce pollution. There are also other factors that can substitute the place of driving. A suggestion was made by Mimi Sheller, who is a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of the University\\'s Policy center and Mobilities Research. She said that \"The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends.\" Also that \"the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangments, including the evolution of shared services for getting to work.\" Bill Ford, who is the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company has also suggested factors for safety and transportation. \"He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which \\'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\\'\" Using cars for transporation is mostly a problem, even if authorities have enforced a law for it, if it causes pollution or even danger in cities. But, it can only be a good thing if individuals are limiting the usage of it.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passage set provides examples of communities and cities that have implemented measures to reduce car dependency and promote alternative modes of transportation. These examples highlight some key benefits of limiting car usage, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased physical activity.\\n\\nOne advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By reducing car usage, communities can make a significant impact on reducing these emissions. For example, the German suburb of Vauban has seen a decrease in car ownership, with 57 percent of families selling their cars to move there. This has resulted in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the area. Similarly, the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, thereby decreasing the city\\'s overall carbon footprint.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality. The passage set mentions the smog problem in Paris and how it led to a driving ban in the city. The ban resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and improved air quality. This highlights how limiting car usage can directly improve the health and well-being of citizens by reducing air pollution. Additionally, by promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or public transportation, communities can contribute to cleaner air and a healthier living environment.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can also have positive impacts on physical activity. The passage set mentions how suburbs like Vauban are designed to be more compact and accessible to public transportation, with stores located within walking distance. By creating communities that are more walkable and bike-friendly, individuals are encouraged to engage in physical activity as part of their daily routines. This can have numerous health benefits, such as reduced obesity rates and improved cardiovascular health.\\n\\nOverall, limiting car usage can have wide-ranging advantages for both individuals and society. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting physical activity, communities can create healthier and more sustainable environments. It is important for individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards implementing measures to promote alternative modes of transportation. By doing so, we can create a more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[State Senator’s Name]\\n[State Senator’s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n\\nDear [State Senator’s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether it should be kept or replaced by a popular vote system in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments from various perspectives, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for five key reasons.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner highlights, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputed outcomes are less likely under this system compared to a direct popular vote. In an era with highly polarized politics, maintaining a system that ensures a definitive winner is crucial in avoiding extended election crises.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents all regions of the country. With each region having a different set of interests and concerns, it is important for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on heavily populated areas and neglecting the concerns of smaller states. By requiring candidates to gain support from multiple regions, the Electoral College system helps preserve a sense of inclusiveness in the election process.\\n\\nThirdly, the Electoral College promotes the importance of swing states. In a winner-take-all system, candidates are incentivized to campaign heavily in states where the outcome is uncertain. This means that voters in these states receive more attention and information about the candidates, leading to more thoughtful decision-making. Ensuring that the swing states decide the election helps maximize voter engagement and enhances the overall quality of democratic decision-making.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College restores political balance by giving some weight to large states. Although the Senate already provides a system of representation that balances the power between larger and smaller states, the Electoral College further reinforces this balance. By awarding electoral votes based on population, larger states naturally receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, thereby ensuring that the concerns of both small and large states are taken into account.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, the Electoral College automatically produces a clear winner. This prevents the need for complex and time-consuming run-off elections, which would only complicate the electoral process. The Electoral College simplifies the process and ensures that a single candidate emerges as the legitimate winner.\\n\\nWhile I understand the arguments in favor of a popular vote system, such as the idea that it is more democratic and prevents the disenfranchisement of voters in states with no chance of winning, I believe that the current Electoral College system balances these concerns effectively.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College should be preserved due to the certainty of outcome it provides, its ability to ensure that the President represents all regions of the country, the importance it places on swing states, the balance it restores to large states, and its ability to avoid run-off elections. These practical reasons outweigh the arguments for a popular vote system and demonstrate the strengths of the Electoral College in our democratic process.\\n\\nThank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I trust that you will carefully weigh the pros and cons of both systems in making your decision.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]\"All of our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.\" Mr. Goldberg an official of transportation for America, a growing coalition to promote car frees communities said. The world is changing for the better and one of the machines man created, that is one of the world changing inventions of it\\'s time is coming down for it\\'s throne is the car. So what are the reasons for not getting a car? lets find out.\\n\\nIn Germany, that is coming faster than people think. An idea called \"Smart planning is taking hold in an experimental town built in 2006 named Vauban. A place were cars are a thing of the past. People everyday are not driving to school or work they are walking, bicycling, or taking the tram into the town from the suburb. Smart planning is revolutionary building towns to not be dependent on driving. 70% of vaughn\\'s families do not own car and are much happier to not have the everyday anxiety of driving a motor engine car everyday. 57% sold there car just to move into the small town of Vauban. Car free suburbs and town are a growing trend all across Europe, the united states and many more nations. These efforts have been making cities, towns, and suburbs denser so you don\\'t have to go far to get some milk and eggs.\\n\\nThe global warning is a huge part of the fight to make the earth our home more better and healthier for generations and generations to come. Cars emit gas emissions that make up 12% of the greenhouse gases in our environment, up to 50% percent in carintensive areas in the United States and around the world.\\n\\nFrance, Paris having heavy smog decided to have a partial ban on driving making even numbered license plates not drive or fear a fine. Congestion went down after the experiment. What was to blame for the smog was the Diesel fuel being used in most cars because of the fact that a tax policy favors diesel fuel over gasoline. Paris having more smog than the typical capital had a decrease in congestion and the citiy after enormous victory decided to go at it again and do odd numbered license cars.\\n\\nThe car culture is one the has had enormous effect on the everyday lives citizens around the world. In the United states, \"Recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.\" In America where the car culture has turned us into the number one place in the world to find the history of one of the planets world changing innventions. People want a greener earth and benifits of not owning a car because everybody knows the stress of having a car no matter ho much it helps you. The car in which you have to have insurance, life insurance, car payments, you have to keep up with your car, the dangers associated with having a car and stress plus anxiety that comes with a car. The cons outweight the pros but those pros have an enormous effect. People are changing and the percentile of teenagers and young adults have droped ten fold in getting or renewing a license. The new trend is that people are no longer getting cars or licenses so why should you.\\n\\nThe people of planet earth understand the pros or cons of a car the benifits of not diving and are making for that change. One of the worlds greatest innventions is stepping off there throne.Dear State Senator, After experiencing the dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote in 2000 I realized that the Electoral College is an old fashioned and unfair voting system for our next presidents. The vote of all United States citizens should be taken account but with each state only getting a single vote it is highly unethical for a state with 500,000 voters like Wyoming and a state with 35 million voters like California having the same amount of votes.\\n\\nThe candidates who of course want to win will want to spend there time campaigning in states they think they have a chance of winning over but what about states that they do not think will vote for them? States like South Carolina and Rhode Island during the 2000 campaign didn\\'t even see the candidates at all. This all because of the winner take all system established in the Electoral College.\\n\\nThere are people who still support the electoral college but on what end? They say it has a more certainty of outcome but there have been past cases where the electoral college almost hit a tie. In my opinion the odds of default outcome in Electoral College is the same as the odds there would be in popular vote for the United States Past presidents like Bod Dole, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter even agreed to destroy the Electoral College. If even presidents want to abolish the Electoral College then what is stopping us from doing so. It\\'s time we make a change to this irrational way of voting and start valuing the opinions of each United States citizen. The only way to do this is to start having direct elections and stop using the Electoral College way of voting. I am positive that this will have a positive affect on how people look up to the government because it will finally make them feel that the government values there opinions.Bustling traffic fills every available lane on the highway on your drive home from work. It\\'s rush hour again, and it\\'s more of a slow, steady crawl rather than a drive. You can\\'t roll the windows down to relax and get a breath of fresh air, because the air simply isn\\'t appealing It\\'s all emissions from the other cars, and the smell of burning gasoline is simply nauseating. It\\'s moments like this when you recall the stories in the news about cities all over the world limiting car usage, and wondering how useful or effective it really is. Banning the use of cars has advantages such as helping to reduce pollution, reducing stress, and conserving resources.\\n\\nPollution is a prominent problem in every society today, and often times you witness \"Go Green\" campaigns on the television, with celebrities trying to persuade you, and call you to action on trying to save the Earth. A great way to actually help reduce pollution, is through a \"No Driving\" campaign. In the document written by Robert Duffer, he discusses how Paris partially bans driving in order to \"clear the air of the global city.\" A system was put in place that allowed drivers who only had odd numbered license plates to drive on Monday, and only even numbered plates the following day. This helped to reduce congestion on the streets, and reduce the smog polluting the air to a safer amount. Before this was put in place, it was said that \"The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\" In \"The End of Car Culture\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author also discusses how \"If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment...\" This is expressing how a lower percentage of car usage compares statistically to a lower percentage of carbon emissions in the air, which stresses a healthier environment. Maybe now we can roll down some windows while on the highway.\\n\\nStress is a major factor in everyone\\'s life It makes things difficult, wavers a person\\'s focus, and isn\\'t beneficial to your health in the slightest. These \"No Driving\" campaigns are actually helping to reduce the amount of stress in people, by giving them a chance to do some stress relieving activities, such as bike riding or rollerblading. In the first source, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" which is also by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a mother of two and media trainer named Heidrun Walter stated \"When I had a car, I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" Walter was able to stroll on sidewalks and smell the fresh air, all while listen to the sounds of nature and children playing, free of the sound of cars. In Andrew Selsky\\'s article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" Selsky informs the reader that Bogota makes renovations in the district on parks and sidewalks, so that during the time of \"No Cars,\" people have enjoyable options as to how to get around the city. With such dedication to a project, it would be surprising to not be satisfied with those results.\\n\\nNonrenewable resources are what power our daily lives, from gasoline to coal, once it\\'s gone, it\\'s gone for good. With these campaigns to ban driving, we are helping to hold on to what we have, and in a way, realizing what we have before it becomes something we had. In the second article, Paris banned driving to reduce smog, which they blamed on the use of diesel fuel rather than gasoline. The use of diesel fuel may be helping to conserve gasoline, but it\\'s used in Paris because of a tax on gasoline, and is simply a prefferable price. By not driving at all, the citizen reduced smog, and conserved their resources for another day. In Rosenthal\\'s second article, she discusses how Bill Ford put forward a proposal on partnership, hoping to \"create cities in which \\'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\" With the conservation of nonrenewable resources, we are helping to ensure a future for those who success our generations.\\n\\nThere are so many advantages to driving, like being able to travel long distances faster, and being able to carry things with you wherever you go, but they are advantages of circumstance, and ultimately the use of cars is a price we pay with our health. The advantages of using other forms of transportation outnumber the advantages of car usage, both in the health of the people, and the health of the planet.Dear Florida Senator, There is a major problem in how we elect presidents. The electoral College has to be replaced with a direct election because of how misrepresented many voters are, and how a candidate could lose the majority vote and yet still win the election.\\n\\nThe first problem of the Electoral College is that everyone is not represented. According to Bradford Plumer in paragraph 10, \"... voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president... Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.\" and because the voters cannot directly control who they vote for, the electors could choosing a different person than who they said they would, which means that the voters are misrepresented. Another way that voters can become misrepresented is because of confusion. Since voters sometimes get confused about who the electors are voting for, they could end up voting for the wrong person. Also, the Office of the Federal Register states in paragraph 7 \"Most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation\". Due to the \"winnertakeall\" system, many people are not represented in the electoral votes, especially in large, one sidedstates. As a result of this, many of the minorities do not even vote because they know that their vote will not win the state.\\n\\nAnother reason that the electoral College should be replaced with a direct vote is because of how the majority does not get the candidate they chose. In paragraph 16, Richard A. Posner states that \"It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the firs time since 1888.\" and because of the fact that the electoral votes are the deciding factor in choosing a president and not the majority, most of America did not get who they wanted to see as their leader and president. Even though this hardly ever occurs, it still hasto be fixed. As a result, Bradford Plumer states in paragraph 9, that \"over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" which would be a true democracy, unlike the Eectoral College. The Electoral College also has an even number of people in it, which means there could be a tie. However, the Electoral College \"requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal\" according to Richard A. Posner in paragraph 19. This is not a good thing because when a certain state or region is struggling, a transregional president will not focus their attention on that area of weakness. In a direct democracy, the voters could vote for a president that has an area of expertise in that region or state and could give them a much needed boost, leading to less weaknesses and an allaround better country.\\n\\nTo summarize this completely, the Electoral College has to go. It is unfair, misrepresentful, and is not even a democracy. Eventualy, it has to change.Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nIntroduction:\\nLimiting car usage is an idea gaining traction around the world as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the adverse effects of pollution. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage based on the information presented in the passage set.\\n\\nBody Paragraph 1: Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a considerable portion of these emissions, with Europe attributing 12 percent and some car-intensive areas in the United States up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions to automobiles (Passage 5). By promoting alternatives to car ownership and usage, communities can contribute to a significant reduction in carbon footprints and combat climate change effectively.\\n\\nBody Paragraph 2: Improved Air Quality\\nLimiting car usage also has a direct positive impact on air quality. In Paris, for example, a partial driving ban was enforced due to severe smog, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality (Passage 14). This measure demonstrates that reducing car usage, even temporarily, can have an immediate and tangible benefit in terms of cleaner air. Implementing similar initiatives in other cities can significantly improve public health by reducing respiratory illnesses caused by pollution.\\n\\nBody Paragraph 3: Increased Accessibility to Public Transportation\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative means of transportation, such as public transit. The German suburb of Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden, exemplifies this approach (Passage 2). By designing communities with proximity to public transportation systems, residents have greater accessibility and are more likely to utilize buses, trams, and trains. This shift can result in decreased traffic congestion, reduced carbon emissions, and improved mobility for individuals who may not have access to private vehicles.\\n\\nBody Paragraph 4: Enhanced Quality of Life\\nLimiting car usage also offers an improved quality of life for residents. In Vauban, where a majority of families have given up car ownership, residents reported feeling less stressed and happier (Passage 3). The absence of cars creates a quieter and safer environment, encouraging more active modes of transportation, such as walking and biking. Additionally, proximity to essential services, like stores and amenities, promotes a sense of community and fosters healthier lifestyles.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various communities worldwide. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting alternative transportation options, and enhancing the quality of life for residents, limiting car usage can contribute significantly to a sustainable and vibrant future. Governments, city planners, and individuals must rally behind these methods, adopting smart planning principles and prioritizing people-centered development to ensure a cleaner, healthier, and more accessible environment for all.All throughout the world, experiments are taking place that replace the personal automobile with safer and more environment sensitive choices. Life in places, such as Vauban, Germany, is built around the lack of cars. Bogota, Colombia hosts their own Day Without Cars. Although this scale of events hasn\\'t happened America yet, the youth of the United States aren\\'t using cars as much as they used to. In all these cases, quality of life has improved and the environment isn\\'t suffering as much as it previously did.\\n\\nThe residents of Vauban, Germany have made a monumental decision in the aspect of cars. According to the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , in the new district of Freiburg, the only cars that run in the streets are the trams that run to downtown Freiburg. This is done so that \"stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.\" This \"smart planning\" allows people to get to where they need to go without using cars. Placing busy businesses on a main street would normally be a bad idea because of the amount of congestion it would cause. In places like this, congestion isn\\'t a thing that can happen. A walk could get you to central places allowing you to access the more important of places. The same article states that \"passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emitions.\" The environment is in a state of constant decline with the amount of greenhouse gasses and chemicals we are exposing to it. The lack of cars is a great way to put us in the right direction. The article mentions that cars were responsible for \"up to 50 percent of greenhouse gasses in some carintensive ares in the United States.\" Imagine how much clearer the sky would be with smog reduced by half. The implications of removing cars from our lives could mean the difference between severe global warming and living happy and healthy.\\n\\nThree cities, deep within the Colombian urban areas, host a day where cars are not allowed. Andrew Selsky describes how \"parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven,pitted sidewalks rushhour traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" In Bogota, this singular day where cars were banned gave people a reason to try out public transportation and personal locomotion. Paris took a similar approach when, According to Robert Duffer, they \"enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of he global city.\" Cars with evennumbered license plates were enforced to not be driven. The oddnumbered plates were the ones that were taken off the streets the next day. The two day ban allowed the environment to recover after extremely high smog levels. The rule that was applied in the Colombian cities was also enforced in the worldwide city of Paris. Both cities benefited greatly from a temporary ban of cars.\\n\\nCar culture has always been strong within America. Elisabeth Rosunthal implies that for several decades, cars were a musthave object, but now, the youth are not as interested as the previous generations. Rosunthal shows how \"America\\'s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miled driven in the United States peaked in 200 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspecive.\" If the largest cities stopped relying on cars as much, everybody would benefit. Even the car companies would have something to gain with advances in more personal vehicles such as bicycles. The environment would have an immense amount of weight taken off of its shoulders. In the US, where the 2nd highest source of environmental harm is cars, the impact would be monumental. The article relates that \"people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume hte habit.\" Teens all across America are carpooling and finding new ways to help the environment while also getting to where they need to go.\\n\\nLife is getting too busy. There is always something that needs to be done. Cars may help but there will never be enough hours in the day to do everything. Leaving personal transportation behind will be the next big step towards a more relaxed and stressless life. The advantages easily outweigh the disadvantages.The Electoral College has made everything easier on people. They keep votes fair, clear and concise and make them uncomplicated. Although there are some against the idea, the benefits outweigh the detriments immensely.\\n\\nBradford Plumer author of \" \" insists that \"the electoral college is unfair to voters\"source 2 paragraph 13. This is surely an opinion as he is just trying to deride the Electoral College. However majority of states vote in favor of the Electoral College anyway. It gives a simple vote to people and produces a clear winner. Also he states that \"the House\\'s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.\"p.12 He thinks that one representative cant speak for his region, but thats why they vote right? He represents the majority supplementing a clear representation of his stateregion.\\n\\nAlso columnist Richard Posner implies that the Electoral College has \"a presidential candidate that has transregional appeal\" Source 3 paragraph 19. So the presidential candidate can be based off a full region or more, not just a few states. This makes the vote obvious and is a more fair vote. Also the Office of Federal Register tells us there are 538 electors with a 270 majority int the Electoral CollegeSource 1 paragraph 3. Not only is there great variety present but with many votes they make the result concise.\\n\\nNot only is the Electoral College making votes concise and fair, also it is currently working. Bradford Plumer states \"The electoral college is...outdated\"Source 2 paragraph 14. How can it be so obsolete if it is presently working out. The Electoral College is giving the vote meaning and depth in that it gives voters the choice of president and his electors. The Office of the Fedral Register informs us \"You help choose you state\\'s electors when you vote for your president\"Source 1 paragraph 6. This gives the voters more voting power as the get to help choose other things in goverment.\\n\\nEven though there are many counterclaims, the benefits surely outweigh the detriments. Its nearly a perfect system. The fair, multifarious choices, and clear voting of the Electoral college proves it deserves it\\'s stay in the goverment.\"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\" Rosenthal source 1 said Transportation of America official David Goldberg in Elisabeth Rosenthal\\'s article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.\" With air pollution, smog, and greenhouse gas emissions rising all around the world, officials have announced that cars are to blame. With this, many are resorting to making changes in their communities by offering alternate means of transportation and bringing homes and stores closer together. The advantages of limiting car usage include fuel will no longer pollute the air, alternate transportation is available and cheaper, and it would enforce goodwill and companionship.\\n\\nTo begin, a benefit of limiting our car usage is fuel pollutes the air by circulating green house gasses that can cause a dangerous environment to form and by limiting cars we limit this pollution. With President Obama\\'s issue to decrease the amount of air pollution caused by cars, many have realized that car usage is not as common as it used to be. If the number of cars on the road continues to deplete \"and many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants\" Rosenthal source 4 says Rosenthal in her article \"The End of Car Culture.\" By keeping track and trying to deplete the time you spend driving your car the trend of putting air pollution to an end will increase.\\n\\nAdditionally, a benefit of limiting our car usage is being able to use the cheaper and more efficient alternate means of transportation. By using alternate means of transportation such as buses, trains, and car pooling services you are saving gas money and supporting community business. There is a rise in car pooling that has \"facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work\" Rosenthal source 4 says Rosenthal. As these changes manifest many people are chosing not to switch back to driving themselves.\\n\\nFinally, a benefit of limiting our car usage can be found in the better companionship that will result as cities will make their stores closer together and communities more closley knit. In Bogota, Colombia people are practicing \"carfree days\" and relying solely on public transportation. As this happens author of article \"Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" Andrew Selsy, says \"parks and sports centers are blooming throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\" Selsky source 3. Other places implementing carfree districts will never hear the roars of engines drowning out the chirping of the birds or childrens laughter. Infact, stores and public transportation is stratigically placed a walking distance away thus promoting social and physical benefits Rosenthal source 1.\\n\\nThe advantages of limiting car usage include fuel will no longer pollute the air, alternate transportation is available and cheaper, and it would enforce goodwill and companionship. With greenhouse gasses rapidly circulating and polluting the globe it would be acceptional to decrease this by not driving as often. Furthermore, by using alternate transportation such as car pooling or taking a bus money is saved on gas and car repairs. Finally, goodwill and good social habits would increase as towns would become more closley knit as everything would only be a walk away. With this it we should limit our car usage to \"save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve saftey\" Rosenthal source 4.\\n\\nDuffer, Robert. \"Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog.\" Chicago Tribune.

Print. 10 February 2015.Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to discuss an essential feature of our democratic process, the Electoral College. In recent years, the justifiability of this method of electing the president of the United States has come under intense scrutiny. I urge you to consider the importance of retaining this system in favor of a direct popular vote, for the reasons outlined below. \\n\\nThe Electoral College was established as a compromise in our Constitution for the critical purpose of protecting smaller states and preventing a direct democracy,which our Founding Fathers were wary of. As explained by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, \"In Defense of the Electoral College\", the Electoral College compels a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. Thus, preventing candidates with only regional appeal, who are unlikely to be successful presidents.\\n\\nThe prevalent argument against the Electoral College lies in the fact that it is not strictly democratic. Indeed, candidates can win the presidency without securing the majority of the popular vote. A striking example is the 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George Bush due to the electoral vote count. Despite this, it\\'s crucial to note, as Posner does, that such instances have been extremely rare throughout our history. \\n\\nOpponents of the Electoral College argue that it encourages presidential candidates to ignore states where the outcome of their victory is almost certain and focus on swing states. However, it must be remembered that the very consideration for these \\'swing states\\' encourages detailed attention to the needs and concerns of a crucial subset of our populace. Every state, regardless of size, plays a pivotal role in shaping the outcome of the election. \\n\\nThe risk of running into a tie in the electoral vote although unlikely, does exist. Bradford Plumer in \"The Indefensible Electoral College\" brings attention to this disaster factor. But, Posner points out that a dispute over the popular vote outcome is ultimately more likely. Moreover, as Posner highlighted, the Electoral College helps to circumnavigate the necessity for complicated and often polarizing runoff elections, which could feasibly occur more frequently with a direct voting system.\\n\\nAs a senator and a representative of our state, I urge you to consider the complexity of this issue and recognize the value in the system our Founding Fathers implemented. Change for the sake of perceived fairness may not necessarily result in a better or more balanced democracy. Let us continue to educate our populace about the intricacies and the vision that the Electoral College embodies, rather than dismantle it.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this critical matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name][Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Today’s Date]\\n\\n[State Senator’s Name]\\n[State Senator’s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: The Electoral College and the Future of Presidential Elections\\n\\nDear [State Senator’s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my opinion on the controversial topic of the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the importance of its preservation. While many argue for a shift towards a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College serves as a vital institution in our democratic process. By analyzing information from multiple sources, I will present a compelling case for maintaining the Electoral College system.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College provides a certainty of outcome that a direct popular vote cannot guarantee. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, the winner-take-all basis of electoral votes in most states ensures that the candidate with the majority of electoral votes also has a significant lead in the popular vote. This not only eliminates the possibility of a disputed outcome, as seen in the 2000 election, but also prevents the need for potentially divisive run-off elections, which could complicate an already complex presidential election process.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College fosters a sense of national representation by requiring presidential candidates to appeal to a diverse range of voters. As Posner argues, a candidate with only regional support is unlikely to be an effective president, as residents of other regions may feel disenfranchised and believe that their interests will not be adequately represented. This system demands that candidates campaign in different states and ensures that no single region can dictate the outcome of the election. The Electoral College safeguards against regional biases and encourages candidates to understand and address issues of national importance.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the Electoral College is its provision for swing states. In states where the race is tight, voters pay closer attention to the campaign and are more likely to be informed about the candidates\\' positions. This heightened engagement leads to more thoughtful voting decisions and the selection of candidates who can appeal to a wider range of Americans. The focus on swing states promotes a fair and balanced campaign discourse, enhancing the democratic process by ensuring that every vote counts and that candidates cannot simply rely on overwhelming support from a particular demographic or geographic area. \\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College safeguards the interests of smaller states, which would otherwise be overshadowed in a system based solely on the popular vote. According to Posner, the apportionment of electoral votes rewards larger states with increased attention from candidates. This balanced representation compensates for the mal-apportionment of the Senate and ensures that every state has a voice in determining the outcome of the election. Under a popular vote system, candidates would prioritize heavily populated states, potentially ignoring the concerns and needs of less populous regions.\\n\\nFinally, it is important to remember that voter turnout is not solely dependent on the potential influence of one\\'s vote. As evidenced by the 2012 election, in which around one-half of eligible Americans voted, it is clear that citizens are motivated to participate and express their political preferences, despite the knowledge that their individual vote may not determine the outcome of the election. Eliminating the Electoral College to solely rely on a popular vote would not significantly impact overall voter engagement.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College should be retained as an integral part of our presidential election process. It provides certainty of outcome, ensures national representation, promotes thoughtful voting decisions, balances the interests of large and small states, and does not diminish voter engagement. While the system may not be perfect, it has proven to be a fair and effective way of electing presidents for over two centuries. I urge you to consider the multiple benefits of the Electoral College system in order to preserve the integrity of our democratic process.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration of this important matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Dear State Senator, I do not like the Electoral College. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It\\'s basically a winnertakeall system in each state. Especially with California it represents 35 million voters and if they are really close and have a tight margin the winning side of the votes takes it all, which means all the 55 representative votes go for that one side. getting rid of it would be fantastic because we could have other options on having a better vote system that is more accurate and fair to the the peoplevoters.\\n\\nFirst of all, an example of this could be Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Like almost all cases award electoral votes on a winnertakeall, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state. the popular vote was very close in Florida nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\\n\\nSecondly, this is not the greatest way to vote because first the voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, which in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you\\'d vote for the slate of 34 Democratic electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president which wouldn\\'t be what the voters want in some cases.\\n\\nThird, according to the Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Next election the voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner couldagain lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. The Electoral college is not the best way to choose, it has minimum chances of succeeding in the future. I think a direct vote would work the best for the voters but yet the the electoral college has its cons.\\n\\nConclusively, the Electoral College is not the best way to vote. By a bare minimum margin of votes, it could cost the election for the other candidate. The bigger state could be a catastrophy and it would be unfair. Last, the Electoral College is irrational, outdated, and unfair for the most part with its winnertakesall.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This is evident in the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, where innovative approaches to transportation have had positive effects. By reducing car dependency, these communities have managed to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and promote alternative modes of transportation.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, cars account for 12 percent of these emissions, and in car-intensive areas in the United States, they contribute up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, as seen in Vauban and during the car-free day in Bogota, these communities are effectively reducing their carbon footprint and helping to combat climate change.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion. In Vauban, where car ownership is allowed but parking is restricted, 70 percent of families do not own cars. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, the streets in Vauban are quiet and free of traffic. This not only improves the quality of life for residents but also reduces the time wasted in traffic and the stress associated with driving.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier and more active lifestyles. Vauban, for example, has prioritized walking and biking by placing stores within walking distance and creating extensive bicycle paths. This encourages residents to engage in physical activity and leads to numerous health benefits. Similarly, during the car-free day in Bogota, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work, promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior.\\n\\nFinally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage mentions that delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban due to smog. However, this can be seen as an opportunity for alternative modes of transportation, such as bike and pedestrian couriers, to thrive. By diversifying the transportation industry and reducing dependence on cars, there is potential for job creation and economic growth.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. It improves air quality, reduces traffic congestion, promotes active lifestyles, and can have economic benefits. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive impacts of limiting car usage and provide inspiration for other communities to adopt similar practices. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of climate change and urbanization, reevaluating our car dependency and embracing alternative modes of transportation is crucial.Dear senator, I am not in favor of the electoral college. The electoral college may seem helpful in some ways in terms of voting, but not entirely. Think of it this way you vote for a specific candidate, but you are voting without knowing entirely whether or not your votes are making a difference because you have no control over who the electors vote for. I believe this system should make modifications.\\n\\nOur county has already had many problems, and accusations of having a corrupt government. Hearing about the electoral college system, and the fact that as a nation we have almost no power for who is elected, does not help the case of being called \"corrupt\" or \"incorrect\". The people as a whole in the United States should be able to vote for the candidate of their choice, without worries. People who specifically vote for someone running for president should either be able to do it themselves, without having to vote for a slate of electors, or, the slate of electors should be more reliable. As in paragraph ten, we cannot always control who the electors cast their vote for. \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.\" Either the electors need to be more reliable in carrying out the requests made by the people of the United States, or we must make modifications to possible change or all together cease use of the electoral college system.\\n\\nIn addition to the fact the American people do not hace full control over who our electors vote for, we do not even have control over who our electors are.\\n\\nIn paragraph eleven, it states that \"legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" If you were truly in favor of protecting the rights given to the people of this country, you would notice this system is wrong. No control over our votes, and no control over the electors? Something must change.\\n\\nTake into consideration how our country is affected every time a new president is elected. Sometimes this effect is good, others not so much. The popular vote should be able to decide who is elected for president because those who are voting will be effected greatly by the change in presidency. Popular vote means the vote cast the most, the vote submitted most, the vote a large majority presented. The popular vote is always at risk of being defied, and there is nothing the common people of the United States can do about it. There is no action we can take to change the election. In paragraph 16 of the article, it states that \"Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed...\" Yes this trust may rarely be betrayed, but it is entirely possible. Just because it does not happen often, does not mean it is impossible...and who knows? What if the trust is betrayed sometimes without our knowledge?\\n\\nFinally, unless I have not made it entirely clear, I am not in favor of the electoral college system. Trust can always be betrayed, even if it does not happen often it can still happen without our knowledge. The people residing in the United States and under the laws of our country do not have full control on who is elected as president. I am, however in favor of election by popular vote. This means that a state casts its vote based on who the majority has voted for, and I truly believe this would system would best suit our country.Dear Senator, I am writing you to explain why the Electoral College system of choosing the president should be changed. The president should be chosen based on popular vote instead of the current system. The Electoral College system is unfair to certain states and somewhat confusing to others. I am certain that my views on this issue are not the only ones.\\n\\nFirst off, the Electoral College system is unfair to states. Candidates for president don\\'t spend time in states that they know they have no chance of winning in. This is due to the Electoral College morphing the states into a winnertakesall system as said by the Office of the Federal register in \"What is the Electoral College?\". This means that the winning popular vote in each state wins the electoral vote for that state as well. The thing is, however the number of people voting compared to the number of electoral votes is unfair. I am aware that the number of electoral votes comes from the state\\'s population, but imagine this California, which has 55 electoral votes gets visited by this tobepresident and wins it over only by a small margin. Wyoming, which has 3 electoral votes, doesn\\'t get a visit by this candidate because he thinks that 55 votes is more important than three and a large majority of this state votes against him. The candidate then loses three electoral votes, but wins 55. Sounds like everything works out well right? Wrong. The other half of the voters in California combined with the majority of voters in Wyoming could have taken the vote if it weren\\'t for the Electoral College. With popular vote the candidates would have to actually care about the states like Wyoming instead of ignoring them with Electoral College. With the popular vote system everyone has a say.\\n\\nTo continue, the Electoral College should be replace because of the confusion it causes. Most people believe that when they vote they are voting for president. However, what they dont know is that they are actually voting for a slate of electors. This slate of electors then votes for who they want to be president, and this might not always be the choice you want. With the popular vote system there would be no confusion and no voting on people who you want to vote for you. Do we really know who we\\'re voting for? Or are we just going on luck? The reason why so many americans do not vote is because they think that even though they vote, they do not have a say on who\\'s gonna win. With the popular vote system we could directly vote on who we belive to be the right choice for president.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College system should be replaced because with a popular vote system there would be fairness to all states and no confusion on who you\\'re really voting on. With all of this said, I hope you consider my request and try to make a change.CarFree Cities Humans almost feel the need to own a car almost as much as they feel the need to own a phone. The automobile industry has been a growing industry since World War 2. There are so many advantages to limiting car usage. Saving on gas and getting good exercise are just a few of the great advantages of limiting car usage.\\n\\nVauban, Germany understands that according to Source 1 which talks about how they have given up their cars! Not only is it saving them a ton of money on gas, car insurance, car payments, and fixing parts, it also gives them all great exercise. If everyone walks everywhere everyday the whole city will be fit in no time. Another advantage to the loss of cars, no car accidents. 180,000 people die a year due to car accidents. The death\\'s in this city will be reduced drastically due to no cars. This no car movement is a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere as a component of a movement called \"smart planning\".\\n\\nSource 2 talks about how Paris has banned driving due to smog. Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France. Delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. The advantages of limiting car usage here is the you\\'d never have to worry about there being smog outside or snow etc. Limiting car usage, you wouldn\\'t have to worry about the weather being so terrible that you can\\'t drive in smog or heavy rain and have a car accident.\\n\\nBogota, Colombia joins the no car movement for what is known as \"CarFree Day\". Source 3 discusses the day without cars in Bogota, Colombia. It is an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It\\'s seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to their city\\'s mayor. Limiting car usage in this city could be great for a lot of reasons. One being they are the only LatinAmerican city to have covered 118 miles of bicycle paths. Their parks and sports centers are now blooming throughout the city. It\\'s uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.\\n\\nSource 4 talks about the End of Car Culture. Studies have shown that as the years go on, driving is becoming less and less popular which is sad for many automobile industries worldwide. In America, the partial cause of the decrease in car usage is the unemployment rate being so low, it\\'s not like someone has to go to work. Gas is becoming to expensive, why would people even want to have cars if they can barely afford them? Riding a bicycle is beneficial for more money in your pocket and more healthiness for your body.What is the electoral college? The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes. The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster? The electoral college should be diminished because it is an unfair direct election, and the disaster factor.\\n\\nTo begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections. This would help our governmental system because as noted by Richard A. Posner, \"There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.\" By keeping the electoral college, we could help resolve runoff elections. What we dont know is if it will permanently work for our governmental system and is it worth the risk? The electors are the ones voting for the president, so we should question whether they should have control to help avoid these runoff elections. The writer notes, \"... the pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by electoral college...\" Posner. Although that is true, that is only one problem that would be resolved by the electoral college, and one benefit is outnumbered by the numerous disadvantages to the electoral college.\\n\\nMoreover, the disaster factor has a huge impact on the electoral collage. The writer states, \"The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse\" Plumer. This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system. According to Plumer, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated again. The writer also says, \"electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please\" Plumer. This goes to show, not only is the electoral college unbeneficial, but they can be sneaky. The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government.\\n\\nNot only is the electoral college capable of the disaster factor, but it also has no direct election. As stated in \"What Is the Electoral College?\", \"... when you vote for your candidate you are acually voting for your candidate\\'s electors.\" Office of the Federal Register. This means, voters have no control over whom controls the country. That is outrageous that the lives of these people will be affected by someone they did not want in the overpowering decisions of their country. Writer Plumer states, \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair too voters\" as well as \"The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" Plumer. Both of these point go to show that the electoral college is lowering our hopes for the government. The writer also notes, \"candidates don\\'t spend time in states they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states\" Plumer. This proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead of our countries government. Are we going to sit here and let them take advantage of their power that will lead us towards disaster?\\n\\nAll in all, the electoral collage should be banished from the government.I wholeheartedly believe the United States should keep the electoral College because the people voting are more legit, the voters are more educated in government topics than most, and citizens still have a say in the vote. Some citizens need to realize that electing a president is a big deal. Electors have more knowledge than most citizens about those government choices and which is best for The United States. Just because it says a citizen is qualified to vote does not always mean that person is making the correct decision. The electoral college electors uses their votes on legit reasons and what can benefit their country.\\n\\nElectoral College is the way to go because the people voting are more legit. These Electors see what the people who are running for president and vice president have to offer. If they feel it is more beneficial than what the other presidentvice president has to offer, they will vote for that president. Most citizens understand what the president and vice president is trying to do for their country but the other citizens who are only voting because they can, do not. These citizens still effect the elect of the president and vice president and that\\'s why the electoral college is a must have.\\n\\nElectors are usually more educated in government topics than most citizens. The electors are people from the House of Representatives and Senators also. For those Representatives and those Senators to get there, they study about the United States and it\\'s government. When Presidents and Vice presidents state what they are willing to do for the country, those electors know if it is appropriate and necessary and which one makes more sense or benefits the country more than the other. Not that Citizens would understand the best choice for the country but more likely than not an electors would make a more educated choice than a citizen would.\\n\\nEven though the electors are voting, Citizens vote still count and matter. Citizens vote for the elector who is voting for the president that the citizens wants to vote for. A citizen can vote for a certain amount of electors who pledged to vote for the desired President and Vice President. If those electors won the statewide election, that desired President and Vice president would get those certain amount of electoral votes. It all depends on the citizens to choose the electors and whoever gets the majority vote, gets the electoral votes.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, the electoral college definitely should stay and help choose the better President and Vice President. The electors have a more legit reason to their choice than most citizens voting, since the electors are based on Representatives and Senators, they are more educated in that government matter, and even though it is electoral votes, the citizens vote count and matter. Without the electoral college, citizens who voted for a president can lose because the people who voted for the other president didn\\'t think about the advantage and disadvantage of that president. Even if it was the better choice, the president can have ideas that don\\'t benefit the voter. Electoral college who be kept and help all citizens choice the more reliable President and Vice President.Politicians and the public have argued for years over one burning question: Should the Electoral College be discontinued? I believe the Electoral College should not be used in the United States anymore. To understand the faults within this system, one must understand the system at its basic level. The Electoral College is a system that consists of 538 electors. Each state has a different amount of electors, granted on the size of that state\\'s population. When the election is held, the voter votes for the electors, not the candidate directly.\\n\\nThe first fault one can find while examining this system is the \"winner takes all\" policy that most states have. In paragraph seven of the first source, the article states, \"Most states have a \"winnertakesall\" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" This system seems unfair, especially in states where the vote for electors is won by a small margin. The votes cast for the candidate who lot the electoral votes in their state are not counted in choosing the president, which hinders the ideals of democracy in this country. In paragraph nine of the second source, the article reads,\" according to a gallop poll in 200, taken shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College, won the popular vote but lost the presidency.\" This crisis in 2000, when George W. Bush won the electoral college, but Al Gore won the popular vote, displays the lack of clarity with this system. This election was a prime example that the president is not chosen by the popular voice, but rather by the Electoral College, which does not accurately represent everyone.\\n\\nThe second fault with Electoral College stems from the first issue: people are not voting because they feel as if their voice is not being heard. Stated as a counterargument in paragraph 23 of source three, the article states, \"It can be argued that the Electoral College method...may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California.\" People are choosing not to vote because they feel as if their voice is being shadowed by the major political thinking in their state, and this mindset corrupts the institution of democracy in the United States.\\n\\nAn argument made by those in favor of the Electoral College can found in paragraph 20 of source three, \"Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign...They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average and the most thoughtful voters shoule be the ones to decide the election.\" This argument is opinionated and has no substantial evidence behind it. According to source 2 in paragraph 13, \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all.\" This was due to the candidates spending their time, money, and efforts to win over \"swing states\", the states that could go either Republican or Democrat depending on the candidates that year.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is a system that should not be used anymore because it does not properly consider the opinions of all voters, turns away voters who believe they will not have their voices heard, and leave states without seeing ads or candidates during the election because these candidates are trying to win over other states.After the research I have done I think that changing the system would be a good idea because of the followingg reasons, its not really fair because your not actually voting for the president, but for a slate of electors, also becuse of the candidates are more focused on the bigg states, and the swing states.\\n\\nThe first reason that changing the system is a good idea is that lots of people think that it is unfair. Like in source 2 by bradford Plumer, \"If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John kerry, You\\'d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.\" but if the electors dont win the statewide election he wouldnt get the votes, so its like your vote didn\\'t even count. The winner take all system is unfair because your actualy not choosing your own president.\\n\\nThe next problem are the big staes. The candidates dont spend many time is the small state because they now that those votes won\\'t really help them win so the go to the bigger states where they now they will get more votes. In source 3 by Richard A. Posner says \" a large state gets more attention form presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state dose.\" For example in 2012 obama won the votes from florida, get got 29 electoral votes. But if he were to go to a small state and won he would only get a few votes, so its not fair for the smaller states and it\\'s not equal.\\n\\nThe finall issue are the swing states. Candidates focus more on the tossup states. In these states they spend more time and give out more information because in these states the people really pay colse attention to the campaign. The candidates dont spend any time int the staes they now they no chances for winning, that why during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all!\\n\\nIn response, based from the following informatom given I think that The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It should not be the elecotal votes that matter it should be the peoples votes. Also some states dojnt even hear from the candidates because they are busy with the big staes and trying to win over the swing states. If you do change the system you will make lots of people happy and I think that it will work out well for the U.S and everything will be equal.I believe that we should get rid of Electoral College because it seems like that it causes more problems then it does with popular vote. So i think that we should use elections to popular vote over electoral voting. For example, the disaster affect which the state legislatures took responsibilty for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people. Even though that the electoral college has some pros it has more cons.\\n\\nThere are a couple things wrong with the Electoral college. In the electoral college system you dont vote for your president you vote a state of electors who in turn elect the president. If your vote won then the state that you live in would get that amount of electoral votes. For example, if you live in florida and your slate of electors won then your president would get 29 electoral votes. But in there has been a few instances where this system has not worked because of how close the votes were to each other. If there was a tie then it would be sent to the house of representatives where the state delegations vote on the president. This is one of the reasons why I dont like the electoral college because its one big long process when actually it could only take a couple days if we used popular vote instead of electoral college.\\n\\nAt the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states. It is not fair to lot of people in our country that they have to be put into this long process of determining who our president is going to be when they could just vote and then they\\'ll be done if they use the popular vote system. If we get rid of the electoral college then the popular vote system will be a more quick and efficient way of voting for our president. Also, there will be less tension in our country and less arguments going on.\\n\\nIt\\'s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Even though there might some reasons why you believe that we should still have the electoral college there are more dangers and risks if we keep the electoral collge. But if we get rid of the electoral college and put in our popular vote system then choosing our president will a lot easier and it will take away controversy in our counrty.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State ZIP Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Address]\\n[City, State ZIP Code]\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my views on the topic of the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping this system rather than changing to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information from multiple texts, I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and practical method that serves the best interests of our nation.\\n\\nThe Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election by a vote in Congress and election by a popular vote of qualified citizens, as explained by the Office of the Federal Register. This compromise was designed to ensure that the interests of both the states and the people are taken into account during presidential elections. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Each state\\'s allotment of electors is based on its Congressional delegation, providing representation for both large and small states.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of the Electoral College, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner, is the certainty of outcome. Because the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, disputes over the outcome are less likely compared to a direct popular vote system. This stability in the electoral process ensures a smooth transition of power and helps maintain the integrity of our democracy.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College ensures that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal, preventing candidates with only regional popularity from winning the presidency. As Judge Posner pointed out, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, making it necessary for candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters. This requirement encourages candidates to address the concerns of citizens from all regions, promoting a more representative and inclusive presidency.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, as mentioned by Judge Posner. Focusing campaign efforts on these states, which are crucial in determining the election outcome, allows candidates to engage with voters more directly and tailor their policies to address the specific needs and interests of these regions. This targeted approach ensures that the concerns of swing state voters receive the attention they deserve.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College restores balance between large and small states in the political process. As Judge Posner noted, the Electoral College gives more weight to larger states by awarding electoral votes based on population size. This proportional representation allows presidential candidates to devote adequate attention to states with significant populations, even if those states are not the largest. This helps prevent smaller states from being marginalized and ensures that the concerns of citizens in all states are addressed.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. As Judge Posner mentioned, this method produces a clear winner and eliminates the complications that could arise from run-off elections. By ensuring a decisive outcome, the Electoral College contributes to a smoother electoral process.\\n\\nWhile some argue that the Electoral College is unfair to voters and that a popular vote system would be more democratic, I believe that the advantages outlined above outweigh any perceived disadvantages. The Electoral College serves to protect the interests and voices of citizens in all states, preventing candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas and ensuring a more balanced representation of the nation as a whole.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I urge you to consider the practical benefits of the Electoral College system and to resist any calls for its abolition in favor of a direct popular vote for the president. The Electoral College promotes stability, regional appeal, swing state engagement, balance between large and small states, and a clear election outcome—all of which are crucial to maintaining a fair and effective democratic process. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name][Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n\\nDear Senator [Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider retaining this system for the election of the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College offers several important advantages that should be preserved.\\n\\nOne of the main arguments for the Electoral College is its ability to ensure certainty of outcome. In a winner-take-all system, the winning candidate\\'s share of the electoral vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election results. This was demonstrated in the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. Furthermore, the winner-take-all method ensures that even a slight majority in a state can lead to a significant electoral-vote victory, reducing the likelihood of a tie.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College promotes the idea of “everyone’s president.” Since no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own, candidates must have trans-regional appeal to win the presidency. This encourages candidates to campaign across the country, engaging with voters from various regions and considering their diverse interests. It prevents candidates with only regional appeal from being successful presidents and helps avoid the feeling of disenfranchisement among residents of states where candidates focus less of their campaign efforts.\\n\\nThe Electoral College\\'s focus on swing states also benefits the electoral process and encourages thoughtful voting. Candidates concentrate their campaign efforts on states where the election outcome is uncertain, which leads to increased engagement and attention from voters in these swing states. These voters are often more informed and more likely to pay attention to the candidates\\' messages. Allowing the most thoughtful voters to decide the election ensures that the election outcome reflects the will of the well-informed citizens.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the Electoral College is that it gives due weight to large states. Since the Electoral College is based on the number of congressional representatives, larger states have more influence than they would have in a purely popular vote system. This balance is crucial in redressing the power imbalance caused by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By providing greater attention to large states during campaigns, candidates are encouraged to address the concerns of a wider range of citizens and ensure that their interests are represented.\\n\\nLastly, by avoiding run-off elections, the Electoral College simplifies the presidential election process. Run-off elections, which would be necessary if no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, could greatly complicate the process and prolong the period of uncertainty. By invariably producing a clear winner, the Electoral College ensures a smooth transition of power and avoids potential complications associated with unresolved elections.\\n\\nWhile some argue that a popular vote system would increase voter participation, research shows that voters in presidential elections are motivated to express their political preferences rather than exert decisive influence over the outcome. The Electoral College does not discourage participation but rather focuses it on expressing preferences rather than choosing a winner.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College offers important advantages that should be preserved. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages thoughtful voting through swing states, balances the influence of large states, and avoids run-off elections. While it is not a perfect system, it has demonstrated its resilience and ability to maintain the integrity of the election process. I urge you to consider these arguments and support the retention of the Electoral College for future presidential elections.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name][Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is a crucial and fair method of ensuring a balanced representation of the American people in the presidential election process.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College was established as a compromise between electing the President by a popular vote and electing the President by a vote in Congress. As outlined in The Office of the Federal Register\\'s text, the process consists of the selection of electors who vote for the President and Vice President, as well as the counting of electoral votes by Congress. This system ensures that each state has a say in the election, with the number of electors being directly proportional to the state\\'s representation in Congress.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains in his defense of the Electoral College, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral vote is less likely to occur than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because a winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College is almost always greater than their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in each state also leads to a landslide electoral vote victory, giving a clear indication of the people\\'s choice.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates have trans-regional appeal, as outlined by Judge Posner. This prevents candidates with only regional support from being elected, promoting a president who can effectively represent the interests of the entire nation. Additionally, swing states play a significant role in the electoral process, attracting candidates to campaign and engage with voters in those states. This results in more thoughtful voters who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, consequently making an informed decision.\\n\\nAnother vital aspect is that the Electoral College restores balance to the political power distribution between large and small states. As Judge Posner indicates, the Electoral College gives large states more attention from candidates during campaigns, ensuring that their interests are not overshadowed by smaller states. This consideration for both large and small states is crucial for maintaining a fair and equal representation of all Americans in the electoral process.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections, as pointed out by Judge Posner. By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This avoids the potential complications associated with run-off elections and ensures a decisive outcome.\\n\\nWhile critics of the Electoral College argue that it may limit voter participation in states where a particular candidate is unlikely to win, it is important to emphasize that voters in presidential elections are individuals who want to express their political preferences, as Judge Posner highlights. The continuation of the Electoral College recognizes the reality that no single vote will swing a national election and that voters participate to have their voices heard, regardless of the electoral outcome in their state.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College remains an essential system for electing the President of the United States. It ensures a fair representation of all citizens, guarantees a clear and decisive outcome, and maintains balance between large and small states. While recognizing the need for improvements in our electoral process, I firmly believe that abolishing the Electoral College would undermine the principles on which it was established. I urge you to consider these points when deciding on any potential changes to our current system.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the benefits of the Electoral College and the potential consequences of abandoning it. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this important issue.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]A life without Cars. A life without cars would be a completely different than what most Americans experience today. We use Cars for basically everything. Shopping, Recreation, and socialization are all based upon the automobile. As Americans, its the general idea that you go get your license and a car, and its a normal part of life. Not many Cities are based upon the ideals of not needing a vehicle. Places where people can walk to the place they want to eat, or efficient public transportation so they can arrive at the movies on time. Everything they need as components of their lives in in reach.\\n\\nA smart town is compact, meaning everything you need for a town smushed together. With everything being compacted, resources can be better managed, meaning more resources can be used in a general thing, or just not used at all. Not needing to use enormous amounts of resources is better for the environment, and the tax payer. Tax payer not having the burden of all those taxes, means a happier tax payer. All the money thats not used on on taxes can be used to spend at the local stores, leading to a strong economic outlook. All because we compacted our cities, and limited car use. That\\'s an ideal city to me. Making a compact city might not be in America\\'s future though. We like our wide open spaces, and our huge backyards. So maybe what we need to do is invest in a reliable and smooth public transportation complex. Something that can take the population around the area. Transportation that can get me from my place of residence to a place where I can get a bite, or have a good time. A intertwined suburban existence. Where there are no engine pollution or loud car commotion.\\n\\nWithout all the engine pollution or noise pollution that comes out of these ideal suburbs people will be less stressed. Meaning their lives will also be happier and healthier. Imagine it. All because we changed the way we do things, we can be happy, and eliminate pollution. I could see myself waking up in the morning in a nice little home, and getting ready. Then going down the street to where I can take a bus, or taxi wherever I wanted. I would do what I want, and not need a car for it. I can focus on what\\'s really important.\\n\\nLike how much pollution we were really letting off from our cars. Different settings had different levels of pollution, but it all leads up to be a ridiculous amount. If we limited our car use we could make a big difference in the amount of greenhouse gases we throw up into our air. Meaning we\\'ll have cleaner air. Can you smell that? Thats the smell of crisp clean air. There\\'s nothing like taking a breath of air out in the wilderness. Where the trees absorbs the contaminated air only leaving the crisp refreshing air behind. That could be everywhere if we limited car use!\\n\\nA life where it\\'s normal to not have a vehicle in Amerian Society sounds like it would be pretty nice. I would love being able to take a bus or even walk to something interesting. Maybe it\\'s in our future. It may even be right now. Are you willing to try to give up your car? Are you willing to try to have a social revolution and change the way Americans live their lives? I thought so.Limiting car usage can seem like a far fetched idea, but in reality, it helps us more than hurts us. Limiting the usage of cars helps reduce pollution, reduce smog, and reduce the amount of obese people in the world. By doing so, it\\'s not a bad idea to limit car usage.\\n\\nPollution, the cause of the ice caps melting, is an ongoing battle that we seem to be losing. As it states in Source One, \"Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of the green house gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in some carintensive areas in the United States\". If the cities in the United States had these limitations then our percentage woul rapidly decline. In Europe, they have already taken notice of their percentages of pollution and have started to have experimental towns in which there are car limitations put in place. In the town of Vauban, as written in Source One, \"There are only two places to park, the large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space for forty thousand dollars,along with a home\". This is a good way to get rid of all the pollution, by having no where to park and if they want to park, they will have to pay for their space. It also states \"As a result, seventy percent of vaughn\\'s families do not own cars, and fiftyseven percent sold a car to move there\". The people that live there most of them are carless so they don\\'t spend their money on a parking spot, meanwhile some people sold their cars to either to avoid paying for a spot, or to join in the experiment of limiting the usage of cars.\\n\\nSmog, is a citafect of to much pollution in one area. Smog has gotten so bad that Paris, accordingto source Two, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air. The ban was partial as in the article it says \" on Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a twentytwo euro fine thirtyone dollars and the next day it would apply to the odd numbered license plates\". This caused almost four thousand drivers to be fined and twentyseven cars were impounded, according to the article. Smog is a problem that can be fixed just like how Paris got rid of their smog by car usage limits.\\n\\nCar limitations don\\'t just help the environment they can help us as well. Humans have become very obese in the last fifty years then they have been in any other time period. You can blame the fast food, but you can eat fastfood and stay healthy. Car limitations make you walk or ride a bike which can get you healthier. I\\'m not saying go out and be Usain Bolt or Lance Armstong but it can help people to be healthier at the same time as being helpful to the environment.\\n\\nCar usage limitations are a great idea, although most people wouldn\\'t enjoy it. It helps reduce pollution which is the biggest threat globaly. It helps dissolve smog from highly car populated areas. The limits can even help humans by having them ride bikes or walk. The thought of limitations are not accepted by most people but if this is what we must do to keep the earth healthy then we have to do it.\"Abolish the electoral college!\" is a famous statement that was made by Bob Dole on whether or not it would be a good idea to keep the electoral college. Though others may disagree and say that our founding fathers established the Electoral College. Also that it was established with the mindset of helping the American people, but i would like to think otherwise. I believe that the we should change the system by which we vote the president of the United States into election by popular vote. For many years we have been using the concept of the Electoral College and for many years, it has lead to unfair calls and the placing of bad leadership in our country. In the article titled, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\", the author defines what the electoral collage system really is, the author states, \" Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" This system is an unfair system, and can not be trusted. It time for change.\\n\\nThe electoral collage is a dishonesty to voters, it is an unfair system. In \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\", the author makes a good claim. He or she talks about the winner takes all system that is affiliated with the electoral college. In the 13th paragraph the author specifically says, \" Because of the winnertakeall system in each tate, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races \"swing\" state.\" That shows how unfair it is to us as the American people. Certain states may not get a chance to see who their choices are. They are forced to make a decision based on the little we know and the majority of the knowledge comes form the media which is a very unreliable source. \" During the2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all.\" That shows how little our voices are heard in a desion that is crucial for how we go about and make decisions in our everyday lives. We the American people have to rely on states such as Ohio for who our president will be.\\n\\nThere is dishonesty every where you go. More so in the electoral college. When the electors are chosen we have no say so. The state legislatures are the ones responsible for picking the electors. In paragraph 11 of \"The indefinsible Electoral College\", the author makes a remark that everyone should put into regards. It says \"That those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" Just like people can lie about their age, electors san also fib about their position or party in which they are representing. The author also mentions in paragraph 11, : In the same vein, \"faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever the please.\"Not everyone can be trusted, and the dishonesty is another reason why we should do away with the electoral college and change to election by popular vote. With the election by popular, we are assured that there is fair play even though some of us may not get our voice heard completely.\\n\\nPeople who are for the concept of the electoral college may argue other wise. For instance, in the article called, \"In Defense of the Electoral College\", the author argues that \" The Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons\", meaning its idea of support. I believe the Electoral College is an overrated nor practical.\\n\\nI am in favor of abolishing the electoral collage amd changing to election of by popular vote. With the system of election of popular vote, you will be sure that the system is fair,honest, and speakes the voices of the American people. As a sentor you should take the best interest of the American people to heart.During my life i have watched many presidential elections on my television. To me the Electoral College on paper should work, Should being the key word. As I read the paragraphs on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not having the Electoral College.\\n\\nHistorical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not having a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.\\n\\nSource 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that \"we\" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.\\n\\nAfter reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in paper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be.In order to dramatically reduce greenhouse gases, a new fad is being introduced all over the world. The fad is ways to make the world more \"carfree\" or \"carreduced\". This may sound shocking and to complicated to implement, but believe it or not, there are communities and cities that are already showing improvement with decreasing greenhouse gases that cars let off.\\n\\nVauban, Germany, is an upscale, fully functional experimental German suburb on the outskirts of Freiburg, without cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are not found in Vauban, the main form of transportation is a public tram that runs to downtown Freiburg. Heidrun Walter is a media trainer who lives in Vauban with her two kids, Mrs. Walter states, \" I am much happier this way\". Completed in 2006, Vauban is a an example of a growing European and United States trend that separates auto usage from suburban life. Everything that the 5,500 residents of Vauban could need is walking distance away, the community is built in a rectangular square mile with all of the stores on a main street.\\n\\nGreenhouse gases from Europe contribute to 12 percent of all emissions, the United States is responsible for as much as 50 percent of these emissions. To most people, these numbers would be meaningless, but to the people of Paris, these number clearly showed with their smog covered streets. Paris hit a nearrecord pollution rate which caused the partial driving ban to take place. The partical driving ban in Paris was as follows on Monday, motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to not use their cars, or be forced to pay a fine, on Tuesday, the same instructions were put in place for oddnumbered plates, this ban continued throughout the week. While this did outrage some drivers, public transit was free of charge from Monday through Friday which did help drivers who were restricted.\\n\\nA national \"Day without cars\" was Bogota, Columbia\\'s way to incorperate car limitations. Millions of Columbian participants found alternative ways to get to and from work. Bogota has a total of 7 million citizens who were promoted to use alternative transportation and reduce smog. Despite gray clouds and random spurts of rain, Mayor or Bogota, Antanas Mockus said, \" The rain hasn\\'t stopped people from participating.\" For a first time, during the previous national, \"Day without cars\" two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event. \"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,\" said Enrique Rera, the mayor of Asuncin, Paraguay. Along with the \"Day without cars,\" Columbia has also put out rushhour restrictions, smoothed sidewalks, and cropped new resturants and upscale shopping districts.\\n\\nAll three cities have showed creative and functional ways to cut back on using cars, weather it be offering new ways to have a less complicated life in Vauban, Germany, limiting the number of cars that can drive on certain day in Paris, France, or creating a national holiday which encourages people to find alternative ways of transportation like in Bogoata, Columbia. It is clear that people in places everywhere are ready to make a change to cut down on greenhouse gases. The United States, as a whole has shown cutbacks on the number of vehicles and licenses being issued, in fact the amount of young people driving decreased by 23 percent from 2001 and 2009. Ultimately, the goal for the entire world is to conserve resources, lower emission rates of harmful greenhouse gases and improve safety, with the rate that cities and communities are going now, this goal without a doubt reachable.For the vote for the president of the United States, the election should not depend on popular vote, but for the Electoral College. The citizens of the United States should understand that when they vote, they are voting for the Electoral College, and that their vote will not necessarily determine who the president is. The Electoral College should be picked more carefully to avoid \"the disaster factor\", but not completely abolished.\\n\\nAs stated in paragraph 1, the electoral college is a compromise between the congress and popular vote. This can serve as a check that determines the president. Just like children are taught in elementary school about science projects, multiple tests can determine the best result. Relying on one voting could put the wrong president in place, and our country is at stake in this situation. If the president presents his campaign to multiple groups of people, it can show what people want in many scenarios. This can determine what the best choice really is.\\n\\nIn paragraph 9 of source 2, it states how many presidents have wanted to abolish the electoral college. It seems that they all could have one thing in common: they recieve the popular vote, but not the Electoral College vote. I could frankly say that this makes them sound like sore losers, and because one of two parties didn\\'t vote in their favor, they want to get rid of it. I\\'m sure they might have some legitimate reasons as to why they want to abolish the Electoral College, but I wouldn\\'t doubt that being a sore loser is one of them.\\n\\nIn paragraph 11, the author talks about the 2000 fiasco. Although he makes some good points about the legitimacy of the Electoral College, some points can be made about the popular vote as well. Many people in the popular vote can choose their vote based on things that don\\'t relate to the campaign, and some people running for president depend on it. They will spend their time trashing the opposing candidate which will cause the voter to think \"This president says that the other is bad and I believe them, so i will vote on the person that told me so\". This is just one example of how just like the Electoral College, the popular vote can be illegitimate as well.\\n\\nAlthough there are many reasonable reasons to abolish the Electoral College, it should not be abolished so that the vote is based on many trials, rather than just 1. We should carefully select our Electoral College, but getting rid of it could put the wrong president in place for the wrong reasons. This is why the Electoral College should continue to be a part in the vote for the president of the United States.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: Support for the Electoral College in Presidential Elections\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the current Electoral College system in selecting the President of the United States. While there are arguments both for and against the Electoral College, I firmly believe that this system is essential for promoting an effective and fair democratic process.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As mentioned in \"In Defense of the Electoral College\" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This significantly reduces the likelihood of disputes over the outcome and ensures a smoother transition of power. In contrast, a direct election based solely on popular vote may result in multiple candidates earning similar percentages of the vote, leading to prolonged run-off elections and potential political instability.\\n\\nAnother crucial aspect of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as highlighted by Judge Posner. Since no specific region in the United States has enough electoral votes on its own, candidates must campaign across the country and appeal to diverse interests and perspectives. This ensures that the president represents the entirety of the nation and is more likely to consider the interests of all Americans. Without the Electoral College, candidates could focus solely on populous areas, effectively ignoring the needs and concerns of citizens in sparsely populated regions.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College system incentivizes candidates to actively engage with voters in swing states. As discussed by Judge Posner, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus campaign efforts on competitive states. This not only increases voter engagement but also ensures that the most thoughtful and informed voters, who closely follow the campaign and its issues, have a larger role in deciding the outcome. This promotes a more educated electorate and a greater emphasis on substantive policy discussions.\\n\\nIn addition, the Electoral College gives due weight to the large states by counterbalancing the mal-apportionment of the Senate, as explained by Judge Posner. States with larger populations naturally have more electoral votes, which in turn attracts candidates to campaign in those states. This ensures that the concerns and interests of voters in populous states receive adequate attention, balancing the influence of smaller states and avoiding a situation where candidates disproportionately prioritize the needs of a few regions.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. As Judge Posner points out, this prevents the complication and potential disruption caused by a prolonged election process when no candidate receives a majority of votes. The Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges, providing stability and continuity in the presidential election process.\\n\\nWhile some argue that the Electoral College discourages voter turnout, the evidence suggests otherwise. As mentioned by Judge Posner, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 presidential election, demonstrating that a significant portion of the population understands the importance of expressing their political preference. The system ensures that all votes within a state contribute to the decision-making process, regardless of whether their preferred candidate wins the state\\'s electoral votes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic system. It provides certainty of outcome, ensures trans-regional representation, encourages candidates to engage with voters in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. I believe that these reasons justify the continued use of the Electoral College in the selection of the President of the United States.\\n\\nThank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully analyze all viewpoints before making a decision that best represents the interests of our great state and the entire nation.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Limiting car usage could greatly benefit the lifestyle of yourself and of those around you. Did you know that motor vehicles are one of the biggest causes of pollution and greenhouse emissions? According to a source by Elisabeth Rosenthal, \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.\" If cars were completely eliminated for a week in an area like New York City, then pollution would be greatly lessened. It would be a good idea to try to take public transportation as often as possible, as opposed to driving to work every day.\\n\\nAnother good reason to limit car usage is to bring together community. There is a city in Germany by the name of Vauban according to a source by Elisabeth Rosenthal, which completely bans driving cars. Inhabitants of this community walk or bike everywhere, which is also a good form of exercise that one could do in order to stay fit. The city was designed with walking in mind, and everything is close by as a result. If we were to have more of these communities, then green house emissions could be greatly lowered.\\n\\nOne major reason not to drive a car is that cars are often very expensive. If you live in an area where public transportation is an option, it may be worth it to not buy a car. You\\'d both help the environment and save a lot of money at the same time! If you\\'re in a city or an area where many things are within walking distance, then you may also notice that there is a lot that you can do, such as walk to a mall or walk to a park, and you would not be harming the environment in any way.\\n\\nPollution is one major factor that should be touched upon more than once. According to a source named Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, \"after days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" Because of the large amount of people constantly driving, it caused the city to become so polluted that they had to ban people\\'s ability to drive. If people carpooled more, or took more public transportation, then this wouldn\\'t have happened. Some delivery companies even complained of \"lost revenue.\" Lastly, it is a good idea not to drive because of the quickly depleting fuel supply remaining on our planet. Sooner or later, we will run out of gasses to fuel our vehicles with, and we won\\'t have a backup plan. Some areas won\\'t even be remotely affected by this, and people have already created hybrid and electrically powered vehicles. Perhaps if you were to bike more and get used to the idea of not driving, then you will be ready for the inevitable to occur. Although you don\\'t have to cut cars out of your life completely, it\\'s a good idea to start relying more on things that won\\'t run out.\\n\\nOverall, driving is fun and gets you to far places in much shorter times than it would take you if you walked there. However, there are many dangers and negative effects that come from driving. To recap, the green house gasses that come from cars are dangerous and harmful to our planet, and there should be efforts to lessen these gasses, even it is simply by car pooling or by taking public transportation. Also, people\\'s excessive driving caused an entire city to have to ban driving vehicles.Limiting car usage would be great for both you and the environment. If we didn\\'t use cars as much, we would get more exercise, save more money, and limit the amount of air pollution we produce. We would start to notice changes for the better in our health, our budgeting, and the condition of the environment. I have gathered evidence from a few different sources to back up these claims. \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Botogta\", and \"The End of Car Culture\" all go into detail about the benefits that did happen or could happen while we limit car usage.\\n\\nOne advantage of limiting car usage is the increase in exercise it will give you. Did you know that 70% of America is overweight? An advantage to walking or biking places that driving doesn\\'t have is that walking or biking will get you active. It will help you burn calories and it will give you the selfconfidence of being in good shape. Sure, it might be hot out when you walk or bike places, but this problem can be solved by simply dressing appropriately for the activity. Wear something that you know you\\'ll be comfortable getting exercise in. One business man riding a two seat bicycle with his wife instead of driving, said, \"It\\'s a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution\", Source 3. Walking or riding your bike to get places rather than driving to them will give you more time to think. If you think too much on the road, something dangerous is bound to happen. Walking to places is a great alternative to driving not only for your body but for your mind, and this, to me, is a strong advantage of limiting car usage.\\n\\nAnother advantage to limiting car usage is you will start to save money. Gas bills start to add up, especially considering the constant inclination of prices. Not only gas, though, but other costly needs such as getting your car\\'s oil changed or tires replaced can also turn out to be expensive. Cost plays a huge role in whether or not teens and young adults will get a car when legally eligible. \"There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license\", Source 4. A large amount of teens just now getting their licenses are unemployed, making the car expenses impossible for them to pay on their own, making them rely on usually a parent or relative. Money has always had a significant effect on how people transport from one place to another. Limiting driving all together would save you gas and repair money, and saving money could never be a bad thing.\\n\\nFinally, a significant advantage of not driving as much is that it would limit the amount of air pollution on this earth. \"...a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\", Source 1. Though we may not notice it, air pollution is constantly contaminating the earth. Air pollution is extremely harmful to inhale, almost like how smoking is extremely bad for your lungs. Reducing the amount of driving that we do would reduce the amount of air pollution we produce with it. Walking or biking does not pollute the earth the way driving can.\\n\\nAdvantages of limiting car usage are not only good for the environment but are good for us both physically, mentally, and financially. If everyone started to limit the amount of time they spend driving per day, just imagine the change we might start to see in the community. We could start by walking to the grocery store or our friends\\' houses instead of driving, and then maybe bring on a longterm change, such as walking to school if it\\'s close enough, or walking to the bus stop so you can ride the bus with other kids instead of driving your own car, creating more air pollution. There are other advantages to limiting car usage, but these are the top three advantages we will begin to notice if we act soon enough.Cars are one of the main causes of air pollution is the United States and the world. If everyone would limit their car usage, one would see all the great benefits of not using a car as much. Limiting car usage helps keep our planet clean and people would be a lot happier.\\n\\nTo begin with limiting car usage would help keep our plant clean. In the article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", the author, Duffer, states \"After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" After this ban was enforced Paris\\' air was cleared in a less than a week. This proves that one doesn\\'t even have to limit their car usage a lot, even just a little bit helps. In the article, \"The End of Car Culture\", the author, Rosenthal, claims that Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, wants to create cities in which \"pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lowers emissions and improve safety.\" This shows that even Bill Ford, the chairman of FORD MOTOR COMPANY, even agrees that limiting car usage would help lower global pollution.\\n\\nOn another hand, limiting car usage makes people a lot happier. In the article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", the author, Rosenthal, states \"when i had a car i was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\\' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two....\" A normal person, a person like everyone else, claims that they\\'re happier without a car, less stressful, imagine what just limiting your car usage would do. In the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\", the author, Selsky, says \"\\'It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\\' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as her rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife.\" This shows that limiting car usage for just a day, takes away stress and helps the planet. Wouldn\\'t it be nice to have a stressfree day?\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage, even just a little, reduces pollution and causes happiness. One can help themselves, while also helping the planet.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage in suburban areas can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This growing trend of car-free communities and car-reduced lifestyles can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more accessible and sustainable communities.\\n\\nOne of the key advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a substantial amount of greenhouse gas emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. For example, in Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. By adopting a low-car suburban lifestyle, like in the German community of Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, individuals can contribute to the reduction of these harmful emissions. This helps in the fight against climate change and the preservation of the environment.\\n\\nIn addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. Paris implemented a partial driving ban due to smog, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This demonstrates that reducing car usage can have immediate positive effects on air pollution levels. By promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, car-free communities like Vauban and car-free days like the one in Bogota can help improve air quality and create healthier environments for residents.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can promote healthier lifestyles. In car-free communities, where walking and cycling are the primary means of transportation, residents are more physically active. This leads to improved health outcomes such as reduced risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and sedentary lifestyle-related conditions. By prioritizing pedestrian-friendly spaces and infrastructure, these communities create opportunities for residents to incorporate exercise into their daily routines, leading to healthier and more active lives.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and accessible communities. By adopting a smart planning approach, which includes placing stores along walkable main streets instead of distant malls, communities can become more compact and easily accessible via public transportation. This reduces the need for extensive parking spaces and makes daily activities more convenient for residents. It also promotes a sense of community by creating shared spaces and reducing the reliance on personal vehicles, encouraging social interactions and connection among residents.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage in suburban areas offers a myriad of advantages. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to promoting healthier lifestyles and creating sustainable and accessible communities, the benefits of embracing car-free lifestyles are significant. As we continue to witness a shift in American behavior with fewer cars being bought and less driving occurring, it is important to recognize and support initiatives that limit car usage for the betterment of individuals and the environment.Cars are a luxury, but others take them for granted. Many people around the world operate cars every single day! Very few people around the world do not own a car, or have never operated one. In Vauban, Germany, residents of an upscale, high class community have decided to give up on cars. vaughn\\'s streets are entirely \"carfree\" except the in the city where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Don\\'t get Germany wrong, you are allowed to own a car, but there\\'s very few places to park the car you own. The only placed you can park are large garages at the end of your neighborhood or development, but parking isn\\'t free here. You must buy a space for 40,000, along with the price of your home. 70 percent of vaughn\\'s citizens do not own cars, and 57 percent alone sold their car to move there. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two. Vauban, Germany completed in 2006, is an excellent example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and other places to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called \"smart planning.\" According to Elisabeth Rosenthal who wrote, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.\" Cars can either be a blessing or a mistake. Cars can tend to put out polluting gases, and endanger our earth. In Paris, all driving was banned due to smog. On a Monday, motorisits with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 fine. The same would apply to the oddnumbered plates the following day. The car emissions were trapped by a warmer layer of air, because of cold nights and warm days. Congestion in Paris, France wa down 60 percent after just fivedays of intensifying snog. This caused the smog to rival Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. That\\'s pretty bad to be competing with China. The Monday where all cars were banned, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates the following day.\\n\\nNow, what about a car free day? In Bogota, Colombia, there was a car free day. Every citizen either had to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during this carfree day. This car free day caused the city to not have any traffic jams, and no accidents at all. This isn\\'t just the first year that Colombia decided to do this, but it was the third! This day is specifically called, \"Day Without Cars.\" 7 million citizens were expected to find a different way to go to the destinations they needed to reach, without their trusty cars. Bogota receives a vast amount of rain storms each day, but the turnout was still at large. \"The rain hasn\\'t stopped people from participating,\" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Many citizens of Bogota said that this day takes away not only their stress, but also a ton of pollution. \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he and his wife rode a twoseat bicycle.\\n\\nAlmost every single citizen in the United States of America owns or drives a car every single day. This has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed the peak of driving? The United States is known for its broad expanses and suburban ideals, and has long been known for one of the world\\'s prime car cultures. It is indeed the birthplace of Model T the home of Detroit the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized \"Mustang Sally.\" Lately America\\'s love addiction with motor vehicles seems to be settling down. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 8 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Most of the explanation to this certainly comes from recession, because broke Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren\\'t going to work anyway. \"What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,\" said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan\\'s Transportation Research Institute. \"I think that means something more fundamental is going on,\" he also said. All of these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession need to find reasons NOT to resume the habit of driving and spending stupid amounts of money on gasoline. The state of New York has a new bikesharing programs and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls refelct those new priorities, as do a proliferation of carsharing programs across the nation. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.\\n\\nMany people around the world have cut driving out of their life for many reasons. Some being safety, money, and pollution.Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities alike. Several examples from different parts of the world show the positive impact that reducing reliance on cars can have on the environment, health, and quality of life.\\n\\nOne striking example is the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden on the streets. In Vauban, car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park, and as a result, 70 percent of families do not own cars. This has led to a happier and less stressed community, as stated by residents themselves. Vauban is part of a larger trend in Europe and the United States to separate suburban life from car use, known as \"smart planning.\" This movement aims to make suburbs more compact, walkable, and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions caused by cars, which account for a significant portion of emissions in both Europe and the United States.\\n\\nParis, France, implemented a partial driving ban due to severe smog caused by car emissions. The ban was effective in reducing congestion by 60 percent, and while it caused inconveniences for some businesses, exceptions were made for certain vehicles like hybrids and cars carrying multiple passengers. This temporary ban demonstrates the immediate impact that limiting car usage can have on reducing air pollution and improving air quality.\\n\\nIn Bogota, Colombia, an annual car-free day is held to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians participate in activities like biking, walking, or taking buses to work, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. This event has been successful in raising awareness about the benefits of reducing car usage and has inspired other cities to implement similar initiatives.\\n\\nThe shift away from car culture is also happening in the United States. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less each year. While part of this decline can be attributed to the economic recession, it is also driven by a fundamental change in behavior. Factors such as advances in technology, the rise of telecommuting, and the availability of alternative transportation options like bike-sharing and carpooling have contributed to this cultural shift away from car ownership.\\n\\nReducing car usage can have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is one of the largest sources of emissions in the United States. It can also improve quality of life by reducing congestion, promoting physical activity through alternative modes of transportation, and creating more walkable and livable communities.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages, from reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution to improving community health and quality of life. Examples from different parts of the world demonstrate the positive impact of reducing car reliance through initiatives such as car-free neighborhoods, temporary driving bans, and car-free days. This shift away from car culture is not only beneficial for the environment but also for individuals and communities, leading to happier, healthier, and more sustainable lifestyles.A decline in the use of motor vehicles would greatly help the whole world in many unique ways. Most importantly, cars have an awful effect on the environment. Eliminating motor vehicles all together would remove many of the pollutants effecting the environment. Also, removing cars has a great effect on the community as well by helping places to grow and prosper. Finally, the thought of limiting car usage is trending rapidly with the common man as well as higher ups in the government.\\n\\nCars produce up to 12% of Europe\\'s greenhouse gases and up too 50% of America\\'s greenhouse gas. High levels of greenhouse gas absorb heat and prevent it from leaving Earth\\'s atmosphere causing a rise in temperature better known as global warming. Second, the carbon monoxide and other noxious chemicals that are released by vehicles can come together to form a thick smog. This somg is very bad for people\\'s health and can contaminate land and water with toxic chemicals. In order to prevent these two things a lack of usage of cars is necessary in today\\'s world.\\n\\nJust like the environment, reduced car usage also can benefit your very own community. Citizens reported being \"much happier this way\" as well as being less tense after restrictions on cars were imposed. Second, a lack of car usage would cause much denser cities. In turn, business that were staged on highways would become local and city centers would allow friends to live close by. Finally, in cities that imposed bans on motor vehicles parks and sports centers were not only revived but began to completely flourish.\\n\\nFinally, laws about car usage are smiled upon by both pedestrians but by people in legislative positions. Fist off, European places like Switzerland and France first adopted these types of rules. As a result, events like car free day in Bogota became a big success with many supporters. Therefore, even president Barack Obama revealed a plan to be imposed that limits the usage of cars in America. Finally, sociological professors like Mimi Sheller have noticed people accepting and embracing the new anti car policies.\\n\\nIn turn, restricting car usage has nothing but good to offer the majority of cities. From helping reduce the global problem of polution. Or, helping to build bigger more tightly knit cities. The new very popular laws will be imposed in many european countries and sonn the U.S. As a result, the positive effects will be embraced by communities for generations to come.Dear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI hope this message reaches you in an optimistic spirit as we continue the always deserving discussion surrounding our Electoral College system and the proposals stirring up to transition to the popular vote for electing the president of the United States. After thoroughly examining the texts provided by several significant authorities on the subject, I am writing to voice my stance in favor of maintaining the Electoral College.\\n\\nCertain counterarguments are often presented in favor of a direct popular vote, pointing out instances where the Electoral College system seems unjust. Prominent among them is the contention that the Electoral College system compromises the importance of every vote, making it seem unequal due to the winner-takes-all setup (Essay by Bradford Plumer, Para 10-14). This argument is validated by the fact that candidates often focus their campaign efforts predominantly on swing states, seemingly disregarding those states perceived to be strongholds for either party.\\n\\nHowever, as Judge Richard A. Posner highlighted in \"In Defense of the Electoral College,\" the system was designed to ensure a trans-regional appeal for presidential candidates (Posner, Para 19). It helps to balance regional interests and prevent a single dominant region from dictating presidential outcomes, effectively ensuring that every section of our diverse country has a voice. Posner further elucidated that swing states keep the election process vibrant, as voters in these states, aware of their pivotal role, may demonstrate more thoughtfulness and informed voting practices, thus maintaining an essential check in our democratic system (Posner, Para. 20).\\n\\nA substantial argument for maintaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it often provides. Disputes over the Electoral College vote are far less likely than disputes over the popular vote, with the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral vote usually exceeding their share of the popular vote, thereby affording a clear winner rather than necessitating complex run-off elections. Such a clear outcome can help maintain political stability and quickly pave the way for the transition of power (Posner, Para 18 & 22).\\n\\nThe fear expressed in Bradford Plumer\\'s essay that the 2000 election fiasco was a disaster yet on the brink of a worse potential crisis owing to the electoral system must be addressed, but not necessarily by abolishing the Electoral College. Safeguarding against \\'faithless\\' electors and detailed regulations over how the electors are chosen could help close loopholes and aid in enhancing trust in our system. \\n\\nThe Electoral College, by no means a perfect system, is nevertheless a deeply ingrained part of our political tradition rooted in a rationale designed to balance power and represent the diverse interests of our nation. It was deliberately constructed to avoid the domination of majority rule while still maintaining a democratic election process. The solution to the flaws should be in reinforcing the system with rules addressing its pitfalls, rather than destabilizing our political structure with a shift to a vastly different voting system. \\n\\nI urge you, dear Senator, to carefully consider the nuanced positives of the Electoral College and work towards reforms that would make the system more transparent and trustworthy for all Americans, instead of pushing for a complete transition to popular vote. \\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your Name]Driving cars can be a danger to humans, but also a threat to the Earth. The usage of cars has plummeted since recent topics of smog, and safety. Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecessary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.\\n\\nLess car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehicle. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog , the author states,\" Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters.\" Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don\\'t have to spend with car trouble, someone could by a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.\\n\\nLess car usage could also help the environment dramtically. Because of the usage of cars the environment has been hugely effected. Since the environment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,\"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars.\" Not only is pollution affecting the environment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increase rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess environments to worry about.\\n\\nBesides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. A main point of less car usage would be for health. The world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the environment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the environment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and grrenhouse gas in the world.\\n\\nEven though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe environment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe environment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won\\'t be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage \\n\\nIn today\\'s global society, there is an increasing recognition of the environmental, social, and health benefits derived from reducing car usage. Various measures are being implemented worldwide to encourage less dependency on personal motorized vehicles and promote alternative transportation. \\n\\nVauban, Germany, an upscale suburb, is an epitome of this concept. Implemented in 2006, the Vauban model reveals that it is feasible to lead a suburban life without heavily relying on cars (Rosenthal 8). Families in Vauban have renounced car ownership in favor of a neighborhood design that emphasizes walking, bicycling, and public transit. By reducing car usage, Vauban has successfully created a space where the chatter of children and the whisper of bicycles are prominent instead of the constant hum of engines (Rosenthal 3). This approach improves the residents\\' quality of life by reducing noise, stress, and air pollution while encouraging communal interactions and physical activities. \\n\\nOn a larger scale, curtailing car usage substantially aids in reducing harmful emissions into the environment. In the context of greenhouse gas emissions, passenger cars are major contributors, especially in car-intensive regions like the United States (Rosenthal 5). An important advantage of limiting car use is the significant decrease in these emissions, which helms the global fight against climate change. \\n\\nMoreover, this idea is being adopted not just in developed countries but also in developing nations. In Bogota, Colombia, a \"Day Without Cars\" aims to underline the use of alternative transportation while decreasing smog levels (Selsky 21). The event was positively received, indicating that such efforts can be successful and adopted in other regions.\\n\\nParis, France, implemented a similar strategy by imposing a temporary driving ban to alleviate severe smog that had gripped the city (Duffer 10). This approach was successful in curbing air pollution levels significantly, by decreasing congestion and harmful car emissions (Duffer 14). These practices demonstrate how adapting car-free or car-reduced living can swiftly impact air quality, which in turn benefits public health by reducing respiratory issues linked to poor air quality.\\n\\nNotably, there seems to be a latent shift in the American lifestyle, which enjoys a notorious reputation for being car-centric. There is evidence signaling that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses (Rosenthal 29). This development suggests that the cultural significance of cars is fading, replaced instead by an appreciation for “mobilities,” including walking, bicycling, and public transit (Rosenthal 35). This shift benefits the environment and, at the same time, responds to modern urbanization pressures such as traffic congestion and limited parking space. \\n\\nConclusively, restricting car usage offers a multi-faceted approach to tackling environmental issues, enhancing the quality of life, and dealing with urban space constraints. As more cities and suburbs adopt policies to decrease the dependency on cars, the trend towards sustainable and equitable transportation will strengthen. It is a model conducive to not just a healthier environment, but also stronger, more communal, and happier societies.In the intense debate concerning the validity of the Electoral College process, it is difficult to choose a position. The Electoral College is a longstanding tradition created by the founding fathers in the early days of the United States. However, the reasons behind the adoption of the Electoral system are not as valid today as they were centuries before. Electoral College was proposed by the founding fathers due to the fact that the average American citizen in the beginning of our nation was a simple farmer, who was not educated enough to make an informed decision in a vote. Nowadays, things are different. General education of the public is very advanced, and there are various easily accessible forms of media from which to learn about the policies and positions of the presidential candidates. After all, the president\\'s job is to care for and protect the people of America, not the politicians. Therefore, shouldn\\'t the people, not the politicians, elect the president?\\n\\nEven those who support the Electoral College must admit it is a confusing system. When a citizen votes for a presidential candidate, that vote really goes to a slate of electors who were selected by means that vary between states and are pledged to that particular candidate, and those electors then vote for the president. As pointed out in Bradford plumber\\'s The Indefensible Electoral College , voters can\\'t control who their electors vote for. additionally, \"voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate\" also bradford . And Bradford makes a good point in the past, \"faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate\".\\n\\nThere is also the fact that candidates for the presidency often focus on \"swing states\", states whose majority is not decided between political parties and whose votes have a large impact on the election. This is due to the winnertakeall method of the Electoral College. In a state that is mostly Republican, a Democratic presidential candidate may not put much into the local campain, knowing that since most voters are against them they would probably lose the state and gain nothing, because all the electoral votes of a state go to the candidate who won the majority of voters in that state. Thus, presidential campains are focused in the swing states, giving little attention to the others. However, if the presidential election were decided by popular vote, campain efforts would be spread evenly across the United States since every voter everywhere counted in the final election.\\n\\nThe method of electing a president by popular vote is a fair and wellbalanced one, giving the minority parties in nonswing states a say in the presidency. Also, it was discovered that \"according to a Gallup poll in 2000...over 60 pecent of voters would prefer a direct election\" Bradford Plumer, . It was even admitted by proElectoral College Richard A. Posner in his Defense of the Electoral College that \"A tie in the national electoral vote is possible\" due to the even number of total votes. Posner also states that \"no voter\\'s vote swings a national election\". However, if everyone believed that, noone would vote at all. Then there could be no election, Electoral College method or otherwise. Therefore, the individual voter does count, and so do all the minority political parties who\\'s electoral slates do not get to vote for the president due to the Electoral College. Popular vote is the only reasonalble system for electing a president who will do their best for the American people. \"Of the people, for the people\". So let the all the people Vote.The United States has been known for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but that\\'s not all. It\\'s also known for the different freedoms made available and its fair government. The electoral college is a system in which states choose representatives to vote on the president. In the past, there was a big debate on whether or not this process was fair. The electoral college is not fair or trustworthy for many reasons.\\n\\nImagine that you picked a representative who said they were going to vote for the person you wanted for president. Sadly, they ended up changing their mind. You could end up with a president you don\\'t like or believe in. Voters don\\'t have total control over who their electors vote for. To me, that doesn\\'t sound very fair. If everyone were allowed to vote, the people would be able to ensure that there vote counted towards the person they wanted, and not towards the candidate they were against. Based on multiple polls, a few presidents have won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote. That means that the candidate which was chosen by the people did not become president. Our founding fathers fought hard for our rights, and it\\'s our right to a fair vote.\\n\\nThere are more problems than just an unfair vote. It almost sounds impossible that there could be a tie in a presidential election, but it has almost happened before. In the past, votes have been so close that only a couple thousand have separated the victor from the loser. What would happen if the votes came out to be tied in an election? Who would become president? I\\'m sure some people could argue that the electoral college could fix this problem, but I don\\'t believe it could. Since there are less people making the decision during the electoral college process, it is even more likely that there could be a tie. If one person were to vote another way, it could be the equivalent of 1,000 people voting the other way. Also, during the electoral college the electors recieve rewards if their candidate wins. The people in that state, or even the whole country supported the electors and helped them make their decision, so they deserve recognition too.\\n\\nThe electoral college is not a fair or trustworthy process. Americans have no control over which candidate their electors choose to vote for. Also, there is a better chance for a catastrophic tie. America is all about being fair and giving people the opportunities they deserve. So, let\\'s give Americans the chance for a fair vote.This essay will analyze, discuss and prove one reason in favor of keeping the Electoral College in the United States for its presidential elections. One of the reasons to keep the electoral college is that it is better for smaller, more rural states to have more influence as opposed to larger metropolitan areas that have large populations. The electors from these states are granted two votes each. Those from larger, more populated areas are granted just one vote each. Smaller states tend to hold significant power because their two votes for president and vice president add up more than the votes of larger states that have many electors. This is because of the split of the electoral votes. Some argue that electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most votes nationally. They do not have to vote for their own state\\'s nominee unless their state has a winner take all system. However, there are states that have adopted laws that force their electors to vote for their state\\'s candidate. It seems that, no matter how, electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most nationally. This is not always the case because of state legislatures who can overrule the electors and vote for the alternative candidate their citizens have selected for them, even if the voter lives in a state without a winner take all system.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and the community as a whole. This idea is gaining popularity around the world as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more sustainable and livable communities. By exploring examples from Germany, France, and Colombia, it becomes clearer how limiting car usage can benefit citizens.\\n\\nIn the German suburb of Vauban, residents have willingly given up their cars and embraced a car-free lifestyle. This has led to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, as cars are responsible for 12% of these emissions in Europe. By not owning cars, residents are able to rely more on public transportation and other forms of alternative transportation like bicycles. This not only reduces emissions but also leads to a healthier lifestyle, as walking and biking have physical and mental health benefits.\\n\\nSimilarly, in Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced due to high levels of pollution. This ban led to a significant decrease in congestion and improved air quality. The ban on cars allowed people to explore alternative modes of transportation such as buses, taxis, and walking. This event, known as the Day Without Cars, promotes alternative transportation methods and reduces smog in the city.\\n\\nIn Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day has become an annual event. This day aims to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. Millions of Colombians participate by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work. By doing so, they are not only reducing emissions but also easing traffic congestion and creating a more enjoyable and stress-free commuting experience.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can also have economic benefits. In the United States, car ownership and driving rates have been on the decline, even before the recession. This decrease in driving has implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Transportation is the second largest source of emissions in America, so reducing car usage can significantly contribute to reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, this shift in behavior can lead to a decrease in demand for new cars, negatively impacting the car industry. However, this shift can also create opportunities for new transportation options and services, such as car-sharing programs and public transit.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages for individuals and communities. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create more livable and sustainable communities, improve air quality, decrease congestion, promote alternative transportation methods, and even have economic benefits. By looking at various examples from around the world, it becomes apparent that embracing a car-free lifestyle can lead to a better quality of life for everyone. It is important for individuals and policymakers to consider these advantages and work towards creating communities that are less dependent on cars.Many people around the world drive vehicles to get from point a to point by. Although this is a good source of personal transportation, it may not bye as favorabyle as people imagine.\\n\\nPrimarily, the decrease in vehicles byeing a source of personal transportation is fairly byeneficial to the environment and ourselves. In fact, this new \"phenomenon\" is happening all over the world. As mentioned in the articles \"In German Subyurby, Life Goes On Without Cars\", \"Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog\", \"Car Free Day is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogota\", and \"The End of Car Culture\", many citizens of many different cultures see that the lowered usage of vehicle transportation doesn\\'t only decrease how many greenhouse gasses are getting in the atmosphere byut also improves our wellbyeing byy reducing stress levels. Not only does it help us relieve stress and what ails us byut it also makes the distance we have to travel to purchase food much shorter, as cited in \"In German Subyurby, Life Goes On Without Cars\", giving us the opportunity to restock our supply over time instead of byuying multiple cart loads at once.\\n\\nSecondarily, according to the article \"The End of Car Culture\", having access to byusses and other pubylic transportation can improve our safety. It is also seen in this article that \"at the Mobyile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford came up with a byusiness plan to create a world where personal vehicle ownership isn\\'t needed or is undesirabyle. His company would partner up with the telecommunications industry to help create new cities and towns in which many ways such as using a byicycle, private cars, commercial and pubylic transportation, and simply walking could bye woven into a connected network.\" With this new plan, there would bye improved safety byy having official drivers providing the byus transportation and private car transportation. Both of these ways are liabyle to give us extra time in our days byy decreasing the probyabyility of traffic and will give us ultimate safety while getting from point a to point by.\\n\\nThere are many cultures in our world today who go along with the plan of decreasing the amount of vehicle transportation. There are many different ways this is byeing achieved and every one of us can bye a part of it.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my opinion on the matter of whether to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments presented in the passages provided, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained. While there are valid concerns about its democratic nature, the Electoral College offers practical benefits that outweigh these concerns.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of the outcome. As stated in passage 18, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. With almost all states awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a small plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral vote victory. This provides a clear mandate for the elected president and helps prevent prolonged disputes over the election results.\\n\\nAnother important benefit of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal, as addressed in passage 19. By requiring a candidate to have support across multiple regions, the Electoral College promotes national unity and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being successful. This helps ensure that the president represents the interests of the entire country, rather than a specific region. It also prevents residents of certain regions from feeling disenfranchised and not having their voices heard in the election process.\\n\\nThe focus on swing states is another advantage of the Electoral College, as mentioned in passage 20. Since the winner-take-all method is employed, candidates concentrate their campaign efforts on these states. This leads to increased attention from the candidates and encourages voters in these states to pay closer attention to the campaign and make more informed decisions. By giving these states a pivotal role in deciding the election, the Electoral College enhances the engagement and thoughtfulness of voters, which ultimately results in a more informed electorate.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College gives appropriate weight to the large states, as discussed in passage 21. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, which grants equal representation to each state regardless of its population, smaller states would otherwise have disproportionately more influence in a popular vote system. The Electoral College balances this by allocating electoral votes based on each state\\'s population. This ensures that a large state like Florida, for example, receives more attention from candidates during the campaign, while still giving smaller states their fair share of influence.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes, as stated in passage 22. This prevents prolonged election processes and complications by guaranteeing a clear winner. With the Electoral College in place, there is no need for additional rounds of voting, saving time, resources, and reducing the chances of instability in the election process.\\n\\nWhile it is true that the Electoral College may discourage voters who know their state is likely to vote in favor of one party, as mentioned in passage 23, it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. People who vote in presidential elections are motivated by a desire to express their political preference, regardless of the impact of their individual vote on the national election outcome.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College may not be a perfect system, but it provides practical benefits for selecting the President of the United States. It ensures certainty in the outcome, promotes national unity, increases voter engagement in swing states, gives proportional weight to large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. By considering these advantages, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I believe that by maintaining the Electoral College, we can continue to ensure a fair and effective election process for the presidency.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Since the rise of suburbs nationally and globally, car culture has been an important component of our history and of the typical human experience. Every teenager anticipates the excitement and freedom of a driver\\'s license, our country is \"the birthplace of the Model T\" and \"the home of Detroit,\" and mothers across the globe rely on SUVs and station wagons to haul their children to and from school, soccer practice, Sunday mass, and the like Source 4. In recent years, however, there is a growing trend of limited car usage around the world as countries promote vehiclefree neighborhoods and as in nations like the USA, \"there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39year olds getting a license,\" Source 4. This trend, while seemingly alarming in our technologydependent universe, offers several advantages, from a better environment to healthier citizens and communities, and encouraging and promoting this pattern may just be as revolutionary for the planet as the introduction of the first car over a century ago.\\n\\nFrom France to Colombia, first of all, governments have been encouraging limited car usage as a means to better the environment through the reduction of toxic emissions into our atmosphere after all, \"passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States,\" source 1. As debates have run rampant around the world about global warming and air pollution, several nations have taken initiative and experimented with the effects of this idea. In the district of Vauban, Germany, for instance, \"street parking, driveways and home garges are generally forbidden,\" and as a result of expensive parking spots for those who do choose to operate their vehicles upwards of 40,000 a pop \"70% of vaughn\\'s families do not own cars,\" Source 1. Limited car usage and public transportation is alternatively being promoted in Germany and elsewhere as an attempt to live our daytoday lives in a way that is healthier for ourselves and the planet. France is one such example in Paris, for instance, \"one of the most polluted cities in the world,\" \"nearrecord pollution\" led officials to impose a driving ban to help clear the air, and almost 4,000 were ticketed with a 31 fine as a result of not following orders Source 2. Free public transit was offered, and a result of the actions of the ruling party, \"congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog,\" Source 2. Likewise, Bogota, Colombia annually hosts a program known as the Day Without Cars that has attracted interest from neighboring countries and cities and provides an opportunity to \"take away stress and lower air pollution,\" according to businessman Carlos Arturo, who spent the day bicycling with his wife source 3. Globally, limiting car usage has resulted in exciting changes for not only the environment, but, surprisingly, public health as well.\\n\\nThe obesity crisis and lack of healthy social interactions, secondly, both are looming global issues due the rise of supersized fast food and innovations in social media and the Internet, and this trend of limited car usage serves as an unseen, advantageous remedy by promoting healthier people and communities. Without cars, people must find alternative forms of transportation, and in Bogota, for example, during the Day Without Cars, \"millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated...to work,\" and since this campaign began in the mid1990s, it has seen \"the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths\" and has resulted in parks, sports centers, and broad sidewalks considerably less traffic and the emergence of \"new restaurants and upscale shopping districts,\" Source 3. A mother of two in Vauban, Germany, Heidrun, Walter, claims that, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\" Source 1. Alternative forms of transportation also allow for increased social interaction walking with your neighbor on the way to work, your kids interacting while en route to school, or striking up a conversation with a stranger on a public bus or tram are all examples of making connections with others that do wonders for our mental and social health.Cars. Everyday the average citizen uses a car to get around wether it be for groceries or just going to their job. It has gotten to the point that many people cannot imagine the idea of living without a car. For those few people who have made the switch to not using a car daily however, have experienced some good things about life without a car. In the passage set it explores the different positive side effects that can come along with not having a car from real life situations. There are many different things that can happen with just this one change and some of these examples you might not have thought about before.\\n\\nThe first two sources talk mostly about the environmental changes that having no cars could bring. Source one focuses on the greenhouse gasses that are produced from car usage. The article states \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.\" This is a huge deal because greenhouse gasses are believed to be responsible for global warming which could become a huge threat. Source two continues to bring up the air pollution problems that are occurring in places around the world. Air pollution can cause a variety of problems from people having problems breathing to plants dieing. The problem has gotten so bad that \"Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\". The problem of smog has gotten so serious that a whole community had to ban driving which is insane that it\\'s gotten that far. Limiting car usage could take car of our Earth the way it takes care of us.\\n\\nThe last two sources, sources 3 and 4, look at the way that limiting car usage could improve our communities. Source three talks about how that cutting back on car usage could benefit different parts of our surroundings. Near the end of the passage it says \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city\". It then continues to list off individual things like rush hour traffic being cut down and sidewalks that were in poor condition are perfect again. The last source talks about the economic benefits that having less cars operating could bring. As a result of the recession people were forced to get creative on how to save money in order to get by. One thing we did was cut back on the amount of gasoline we used which in turn led to us cutting back on the amount of driving we did. This boosted our economy and there in no reason why it can\\'t continue to boost our economy even further if we cut back our car usage even further.\\n\\nIn conclusion cutting back on how much we use our cars has many advantages that will benefit every person living today. There are even more advantages that were not mentioned in the sources above that will improve the world even more. Along with there being a ton of advantages, there are little to no disadvantages. Think to yourself of at least four advantages of increasing the amount of car usage.Do you ever wonder how it would be if we lived in a car free environment where cars where limited. There would not be any traffic jams,or heavy smog,people wont have to worry about gas prices. Our environment would be cleaner and better for us to live in. There are so many advantages from limiting car usage.\\n\\nPeople with cars tend to worry about gas prices and how much money it takes to fill up their car. When limiting the usage of cars,and walk or bike it helps save your money for something other than gas. Just think of it the average person has to fill up their gas tank at least once every one to two weeks, and if they drive constantly then once every three to five days after they had just filled up their tank. Why even waste gas to go down the street to a store or to a friends when you can use a better and more conservative type of transportation, its nonsensical to even drive for a short amount of time if you can walk or bike to you destination. If we also limit car usage we wont have to worry much about bumper to bumper traffic or car accidents. Think of how much much time traffic on the highways wastes sometimes 20 minutes to an hour or two when we can be doing something better with our lives. Not to mention if we limited our usage our roads sidewalks and highways would all change. There would also be more outside attractions to do and be apart of, malls and stores would be different as well considering that if not much cars are around its not necessary to have shopping plaza because not much cars would be parked. Driving a car when only necessary would help people a whole lot and change and impact the way we live in a positive way.\\n\\nThink of our environment and ozone for a minute,and how bad the fules that power our cars effect it, not only does the fules effect our environment it also affects us too. When we have a high amount of smog in the air due to cars it makes people congested because our air is tainted and polluted. How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid the EPA is promoting the act of reduced car communities. Its not just cars either you have motorcycles as well that harm us and the environment ion the same way. Not only will limiting your usage on your car will be better for your wallet it would be better for you as well considering the fact that some people if not using or having a car tend to walk or bike which is exercise and it helps to benifit you out as well as your money. Driving a car when only necessary would help people a whole lot. Considering that everyone is out of shape because of our advances in life a little walking or biking exercise will benifit us from being lazy, you can even make your walk fun with music to listen to. If we limit our usage it will help our environment and our health as people as well.\\n\\nCars maybe needed if you have a job or a place that you need to go that is a far stretch from where you are. Cars are very handy i\\'ll give it that,but sometimes they are unnecessary to use in certain situations. Peolpe like having a car for freedom and having their own transportation instead of relying on something else to get them around, but the thing is that we dont actually need cars that much for things. People are just lazy and depend on cars so they dont have to walk, take a bus ,or bike to their destination but its that mind set that most of us have and thats why our environment is getting killed slowly. We need to stop being lazy and think of better ways to get back and forth from certain areas.\\n\\nCars can are good to have for self transportation, but there are much better ways to get from place to place without hurting your wallet and your environment. There are plenty of benifits from limiting car usage for everyone. When we limit car usage we dont have to worry about gas prices or smog in our environment or anything of that nature. Limiting gas makes us better and healthier because we are finding more physical alternative ways for transportation.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College for Presidential Elections\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to you today to express my strong support for retaining the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While many argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves several crucial purposes that we should carefully consider before making any amendments to the Constitution.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome that is crucial in maintaining the stability and integrity of our democracy. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out in his article, \"The Electoral College,\" a dispute over the popular vote is more likely than a dispute over the Electoral College vote. With winner-take-all systems in most states, even a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide electoral vote victory. This avoids the potential chaos and division that could arise from a contested popular vote.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal and is not just a regional favorite. With no region having enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates are incentivized to campaign and appeal to voters across the country. This leads to a more representative selection of the president and prevents candidates from focusing solely on regions where they are the strongest. The Electoral College fosters a sense of unity and inclusivity by giving a voice to voters from all regions of our great nation.\\n\\nAnother key advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to encourage candidates to focus on swing states. In his article, Judge Posner highlights that the winner-takes-all method of awarding electoral votes motivates candidates to direct their campaign efforts towards these competitive states. This engagement in swing states leads to increased voter attention and informed decision-making. By giving more weight to the voices of swing state voters, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful voters are the ones to decide the election.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College restores balance to our political system by giving more weight to the larger states, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate. As Judge Posner explains, larger states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, leading to a more equitable representation of their interests. This is an important factor that prevents smaller states from being overshadowed or marginalized in the presidential election process.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes. This avoids the complexities and delays associated with run-off elections, ultimately providing a clear winner in a more efficient manner. The stability and continuity provided by the Electoral College contribute to the smooth functioning of our democracy.\\n\\nWhile some argue that the popular vote would be a fairer system, it is worth noting that the Electoral College still encourages a high voter turnout. Despite the fact that individual votes may not always swing the nationwide election, it is evident from the 2012 election that nearly half of the eligible American population exercised their right to vote. This shows that voters are motivated to express their political preferences, even if their state is unlikely to sway the overall result.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the value of the Electoral College in preserving the stability, fairness, and inclusivity of our democratic system cannot be overstated. While some aspects of the system may seem imperfect or outdated, they serve to guarantee certainty, trans-regional appeal, voter engagement, balance of power, and the avoidance of run-off elections. I urge you, Senator, to consider these factors before contemplating any changes to our Constitution. Let us continue to uphold the principles and wisdom of the founding fathers by safeguarding the Electoral College.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take my views into careful consideration. I remain at your disposal for any further discussions or clarifications.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Limiting car usage can bring about numerous advantages for both individuals and communities. By reducing the reliance on cars, people can experience increased happiness, improved air quality, and a shift towards more sustainable forms of transportation. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia highlight the positive effects of limiting car usage and exemplify the potential for change.\\n\\nOne of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in overall well-being. In the town of Vauban, Germany, where cars are prohibited in most areas, 70% of families do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their cars in order to move there. This change has led to a decrease in stress and tension for many individuals. Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, says, \"When I had a car, I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" This sentiment is echoed by many others who have made the switch to a car-free lifestyle. By reducing the reliance on cars, people experience less traffic, noise, and pollution, leading to an overall improved quality of life.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which have detrimental effects on the planet. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the number rises to 50%. By reducing the number of cars on the road, greenhouse gas emissions can be significantly reduced, leading to cleaner air and a healthier environment. This is evident in Paris, where a driving ban was enforced to combat smog pollution. The ban resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and an improvement in air quality.\\n\\nLimiting car usage also encourages the development of sustainable and alternative modes of transportation. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day is organized every year to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work on this day, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. The success of this initiative has inspired other cities and countries to adopt similar practices. By creating infrastructure that supports walking, biking, and public transportation, communities can reduce their dependency on cars and provide residents with more accessible and environmentally friendly transportation options.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and communities. It improves overall well-being by reducing stress and tension associated with driving. It also has a positive impact on the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. Additionally, it encourages the development of sustainable transportation options. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the benefits of limiting car usage and the potential for positive change in communities around the world. By embracing alternative forms of transportation and reducing our reliance on cars, we can create healthier and more sustainable communities for the future.Dear Senator,\\n\\nI write to you about a pressing issue that has been the subject of numerous debates across our nation: The Electoral College. It\\'s an age-old system, a compromise carved into our Constitution by our founding fathers to ensure fairness and promote balance between states. However, prominent figures and citizens alike have suggested its abolishment, favoring the selection of the president by popular vote instead. I believe that adopting the direct election approach will make every citizen\\'s vote count, providing rectitude and accuracy in our electoral system.\\n\\nThe main argument in favor of retaining the Electoral College, as pointed out by Judge Richard A. Posner, is certainly the certainty it offers. Disputes are far less likely to occur, as the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. However, this system creates a significant flaw. The majority rule of the popular vote can be overridden by the electoral vote, leading to a president who may not represent the wishes of a larger portion of the electorate.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College promotes the existence of \\'swing states\\'. While Posner regards this as beneficial, it can lead to potential bias and neglect. Bradford Plumer keenly notes how, due to the winner-take-all system in most states, candidates focus only on the tight races in “swing” states, ignoring others. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states never encountered the candidates and voters in twenty-five of the largest media markets didn\\'t see a single campaign ad. This fact alone does not uphold the fairness and representation that the Electoral College was supposed to ensure.\\n\\nPosner\\'s argument that the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance for larger states also demonstrates the inherent inequality in the current system. Smaller states are often overlooked, as a victory there fetches fewer electoral votes. This approach only amplifies the voices of the larger states, further sidelining the smaller ones. \\n\\nIn contrast, a popular vote would ensure every individual\\'s vote has the same weight, no matter where they are located in the country. It advocates for true democratic principles, where every citizen has a fundamental role in electing the president.\\n\\nThere are instances from history that have highlighted the flaws in the Electoral College. In the 2000 election, Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, indicating a significant divergence between popular sentiment and the Electoral College result. Having said that, it\\'s also important to note the salvaging factor about the Electoral College system is that it avoids the problem of elections where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. \\n\\nTo conclude, while the Electoral College has been an integral part of our election process for centuries, it has shown its limitations in fully representing the will of the American populace. Therefore, it may be time to refine our electoral system, consider an approach by popular vote, which promotes individual empowerment and democratic values.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]We should keep the Electoral College for the voting of the United States. One good reason is they know for sure who is going to the president of the United States because of the way the Electoral College is. This voting process helps avoid a lot of bad things too. There are so many good reasons why we should keep this form of voting.\\n\\nAvoiding RunOff Elections is one good reason why we should keep the Electoral College according to \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President.\" It states that, \"The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes.\" This is good because they keep one of the presidents that got the majority of the votes to win automatically,instead they have to do some math to see who the winner is.\" In the first writing \"What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register. This writing says that \"Most states have a \"winnertakeall\" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" This is basically saying that everyone gets to go the presidential election.\\n\\nSome more key points are some more notes in the first and last writing. In the writing \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President.\" and it states, \"The electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution...\" This is saying that go by a different rule of voting because of the population being than other states. Another good point is in the first paragraph again and it says \"The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.\" This is good that you have a schedule for for the next voting this gives us enough time to vote, it also gives the time to see if the president is good or not.\\n\\nThere is some downsides to this little thing you have going on here though. That is in the second paragraph and it really gets my attention, \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" With this in mind it is telling us the people that we are not voting for the president at all that is what most people believe that they are doing so you are kind of lying to some of them.\\n\\nTo wrap things up I am telling you that your Electoral College system is great in most ways. You should try and change some of those things that are bad about it though. Not just the one I talked about but more that others talk about and doing this can you and all that work with ten times better than you were before.THere has been quite a lot of recent talk of whichh the national government should keep the Electoral COllege, or change to an election by popular vote for the president of the UNited states. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress\"Source 1: What is the Electoral College? by the office of the federal register. IT has been established by the founding fathers to make a compromise between popular vote and election vote in congress. Popular representation is a vote for qualified citizens to take an individual vote cast to the state whichh then is transferred to a representative whole. the are many good effects this popular representation has on the country, but the senator should keep the Electoral College without a shout of a doubt.\\n\\none of the most important reasons we should keep the electoral college process is that in this process, states pay much more attention to the electors due to having swing states. the people who decide on our president should be most intrigued and the most concerning ones. \"voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that theu are going to decide the electionin defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president, by richard a. posner, subtitle Swing States\". MAny voters that are in swing states, whichh are stated that cast the majority of votes in the system with higher amounts of population, therefore congress representatives.\\n\\nanother reason why the gov should keep the electoral college is because it resorts unwanted balance. \"there is no pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes casy that pressure whichh would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, whichh invariably produces a clear winner\" so what this quote from the passage is saying is that no candidate recieves a majority if the votes cast, due to each states fair rep of the population without being overwhelmed by the most populated states such as florida, california, and texas. While you may believe that the popular representation vote may be overwhelmingly more accurate to the people wants , you are wrong. the electoral college is a process in which hgives the people wants in a state to an elector who then gives you an equal chance one voting for what you pleased. he may be the \"biggest\" or \"smallest\" amount of electoral votes, but as a state in a whole yu may recieve a big surprise that there is no clear winner as each president may not be just familiat with one region such as the north east, or the southwest, etc.\\n\\nso as you can see, the government should keep an electoral colllge process instead of the popular representation vote. it would be greatly appreciated to the United States People who may be under informed of how grest an opportunity for an idea such as this to vote up, or they might be over informed of fallacy information of our election process now.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College, as a compromise method established by the founding fathers in the Constitution, serves to maintain the integrity of the democratic process while also ensuring fair representation for all states. While there are arguments in favor of a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College remains the optimal method for electing the President, as it guarantees certain essential factors that a direct election would not.\\n\\nOne significant advantage of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. With the Electoral College system, the winning candidate\\'s share of the electoral vote usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This eliminates the possibility of a disputed result or a close call, as a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could result in prolonged litigation and uncertainty, as seen in the 2000 presidential election crisis.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the President is everyone\\'s President. Since no particular region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates must have broad trans-regional appeal. This requirement discourages candidates from solely focusing on favorable regions and enables them to represent the interests of all Americans. This prevents regional favoritism and helps maintain a cooperative balance among different regions of the country.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College system promotes fairness and empowers states of all sizes. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, ensuring that diverse perspectives and interests are taken into account by candidates. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on densely populated areas, deliberately neglecting the concerns of smaller states. By giving each state a voice in electing the President, the Electoral College addresses the malapportionment of the Senate and provides a more balanced representation of the country as a whole.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the Electoral College is that it avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College inevitably produces a clear winner. This eliminates the possibility of prolonged electoral processes and ensures a more streamlined and efficient election.\\n\\nWhile critics argue that a direct popular vote system would encourage voter participation, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections are those who want to express a political preference rather than those who believe that their single vote will sway the election. In fact, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite knowing that their state\\'s outcome was predetermined. Therefore, the Electoral College does not impact voter turnout significantly.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College remains a vital component of our democracy, providing certainty of outcome, fair representation for all states, and balance in the political process. It promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages candidates to address the concerns of all Americans, and ensures efficient and effective elections. While there may be arguments in favor of a popular vote system, the Electoral College stands as a solid method for electing our President.\\n\\nThank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I strongly urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College to protect the democratic principles upon which our country was founded.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Dear Senator, I am strongly in favor of keeping the Electoral College because it not only is more efficient than popular vote, it is also smarter. The Electoral College is a foolproof way of not disputing the outcome of who gets to be in it. It avoids problems by the candidates not receiving majority of the votes cast in the election. Everyone who is in the Electoral College was cast there for a reason by the popular vote. You also must know that the system has its faults. There aren\\'t many of them but i believe that they are needed to keep the College going and allowing it to vote the right way instead of the wrong way. All in all, i do hope that you are also in favor of the electoral college and if you aren\\'t, hopefully this letter will let your mind sway towards being in favor of it.\\n\\nFirst of these reasons, there are more problems with popular votes than electoral vote and have a foolproof way of keeping disputes in the low. The Electoral College is less susceptible to problems if the poular votes are used to elect the college. In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president, in the first reason it says that, \"...The winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.\" Secondly, Having an Electoral College avoids runoff elections, where the problem is cause by each candidate that is running to not get any of the majority of the votes. To put it in more simple terms, In some cases there have been ties by the popular vote, or very close ties. In The same article as mentioned in the above paragraph provided the example of one time that this has happened. \" Nixon and Clinton both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College.\" The Electoral college breaks the tie in the poular votes because they reduce the pressure of having runoff elections. The states have a \"winnertakeall\" system, so that when the elections come, the president of those who are voting for him in the electoral college get to be with that president. The larger states recieve more attention from the candidates, so the popular vote getting tied up also does not happen very often.\\n\\nLast but not least, it is incredibly important to know how the Electoral College works because if you do not, then you will not know how effective of a sytem it is. In What is the Electoral College?\\n\\nit states that, \"The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.\" The popular vote can get tied up pretty easily, but it is a lot harder for the electoral votes to get tied up because only 270 votes are needed to elect the president. The popuar vote actually elects the College. \"...But each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee..\" and this quote was selected from I defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. The electoral college is trusted to vote for the president that they believe will make the best decisions for our country.\\n\\nEven thought this might be a really improved method on picking our president, it still has faults. In what\\'s wrong with the electoral college, is saying that \"The most worrying prosepct is the tie in the electoral college....in that case the elction would be thrown to the H.O.R., where state delegations vote on the president.\" If this ever does happen, MAny people in the senate or house of representatives would have to vote and would have to rake on responsibilty of the as many as 500,00 voters.\\n\\nAs you know, it is important to keep the best desicions of your country in mind , while thinking about your citizens that you are representing. The electoral college answers the questions of having disputes and arguments over who becomes preseident. It is an efficient way of keeping a foolproof outcome and avoid runoff elections. You also now have some knowledge of how the electoral college worls, if you didn\\'t have any before.State Senator, The Electoral College is outdated, and is commonly viewed as anachronism. In this system voters, instead of voting for a president, vote for a slate of electors. The slate of electors if chosen for the statewide election, would go to Congress. At Congress, they would then vote for the President. For many people, it seems understandably unfair.\\n\\nFirst off, voters cannot control who their electors vote for. At this point in time, voters have no more of a say in which President is elected they can only hope that the elected candidate shares the same views they do. Most of the times, this is the wrong case.\\n\\nSecond off, many times voters will get confused in who they\\'re voting for. They\\'ll pick out a candidate without knowing much information about them, or what their views are. A random candidate will be chosen for their vote, and most times this tends to come to an unhappy ending. Many times, voters will be disappointed and frustrated with how the election turns out.\\n\\nPeople claim this tends to be due to the Electoral College.\\n\\nIt would, in terms, be much simpler to change the election to go by popular vote. This would have many benefits on the difficulty of the systems selecting a President, to how people react. By choosing a popular vote, time of the election would be cut slimmer. People wouldn\\'t have to focus on choosing an elector, or their worries that their state electors didn\\'t share their views. It would give our people the chance to vote for the President they want.\\n\\nIn the end, the Electoral College should be abolished and thrown out. It doesn\\'t make sense to keep continuing on this way, when the votes should be up to the people not random electors.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage has several advantages that can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This is supported by evidence from various sources, including the excerpts from \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" by Robert Duffer, \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky, and \"The End of Car Culture\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal.\\n\\nOne of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Rosenthal\\'s article, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, especially in suburban areas where car ownership is high, we can significantly contribute to the reduction of these harmful emissions. Vauban, a German suburb mentioned in Rosenthal\\'s article, is a perfect example of how living without cars can lead to a reduction in emissions. In this community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. The excerpt from Duffer\\'s article about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights the negative impacts of car emissions on air pollution. When a partial driving ban was enforced in Paris, congestion decreased by 60 percent, and the smog cleared enough to rescind the ban for certain days. Similar effects were seen in Bogota, Colombia, during their car-free day, as mentioned in a passage by Selsky. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly improve air quality in congested cities, benefitting the health and well-being of citizens.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient transportation systems. By focusing on smart planning and promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can create more compact and accessible communities. This is evident in the example of Vauban, where stores are placed within walkable distances and public transportation serves as the main mode of transportation. By reducing car usage, we can minimize traffic congestion, shorten commute times, and make cities more livable for all residents.\\n\\nThere are also economic benefits to limiting car usage. The reduction in car ownership can lead to savings for individuals who no longer need to purchase and maintain cars. As mentioned in Rosenthal\\'s article, some suburbs in the United States are promoting \"car-reduced\" communities, and experts expect public transport to play a larger role in federal transportation bills. By investing in public transportation and creating car-free or low-car communities, we can redirect funds from building and maintaining highways to more sustainable forms of transportation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages that can contribute to a more sustainable and livable future. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more efficient transportation systems and providing economic benefits, there are numerous reasons to consider reducing our reliance on cars. By making changes at both individual and societal levels, we can create a cleaner, healthier, and more accessible environment for all.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State Zip]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State Zip]\\n\\nSubject: Support for the Electoral College\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to you today to express my support for the Electoral College system in the United States presidential elections. The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers in the Constitution, provides several key benefits that ensure a fair and balanced representation of the diverse interests and needs of our nation.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College system provides certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all method of most states ensures that the electoral will invariably exceed the popular vote, minimizing the likelihood of an election dispute. This was particularly evident in the 2012 election, where President Obama secured 61.7% of the electoral vote despite only receiving 51.3% of the popular vote. This prevents prolonged legal battles and promotes a smooth transition of power.\\n\\nAnother crucial aspect of the Electoral College is that it requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own, ensuring that presidential candidates must campaign nationally and listen to the concerns and interests of voters in every state. This prevents regionalism and encourages presidential candidates to represent the entire nation, rather than focusing solely on the needs of one particular region.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention and information from the candidates, leading to more thoughtful decision-making and a better-informed electorate. By focusing on swing states, candidates are forced to address the concerns of diverse populations and avoid relying solely on a specific demographic.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College provides a fair balance between large and small states. The apportionment of electoral votes gives larger states more influence, allowing them to have a stronger voice in the election process. This ensures that the needs and interests of larger states are not overshadowed by those of smaller states, creating a more equal representation for all citizens.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College system prevents the need for run-off elections. By providing a clear winner through the electoral votes, the Electoral College eliminates the complications and costs associated with run-off elections. It ensures that a majority winner is determined, even if a candidate has only secured a plurality of the popular vote.\\n\\nWhile some argue that the Electoral College undermines the principle of democracy, it is essential to remember that our nation is a representative democracy rather than a pure democracy. The Electoral College ensures that the interests of citizens in every state are represented, regardless of population differences, while also promoting fair and balanced decision-making.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College system provides numerous advantages that promote a fair and representative election process. It ensures that the outcome is certain, candidates have trans-regional appeal, swing states receive attention, large states have their voices heard, and run-off elections are avoided. For these reasons, I urge you to continue supporting and upholding the Electoral College system to ensure a fair and representative process in our presidential elections.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the benefits and implications of the Electoral College system when making decisions that affect the future of our nation.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Dear Senator [Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to you about an issue that has been in many recent debates and discussions: the debate concerning the continued use of the Electoral College for electing our presidents as against the shift to a direct popular vote. As your constituent who deeply cares about the health of our democracy, I would like you to advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College. \\n\\nIn these discussions, many critics have pointed out the undemocratic nature of the Electoral College, stipulating that it is unfair and does not directly represent the will of the people. They also argue that under this system, presidential candidates focus mainly on swing states and largely ignore states they know they have no chance of winning, resulting in a lack of nationwide campaign and broader appeal.  \\n\\nNevertheless, while the Electoral College may seem undemocratic at face value, it was designed to ensure a balanced representation between the states and the people, according to the Office of the Federal Register. The system secures a certainty of outcome, ensuring less likelihood for disputes compared to the popular vote (Posner,18). Furthermore, despite critics\\' claim of unfairness, the Electoral College compels presidential candidates to gather trans-regional appeal, making sure they not only cater to more populated states but to the entire nation (Posner,19).\\n\\nAdditionally, a shift to the popular vote might result in candidates focusing exclusively on densely populated urban areas, thus disregarding rural areas. It actually enhances the value of every single vote; in the Electoral College system, the choice of a state\\'s population has a significant impact. In other words, smaller states\\' concerns and interests are more likely to be considered and less likely to be marginalized.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College makes the election process less complicated and by invariably producing clear winners, it allays the pressure for run-off elections which could be an arduous process (Posner,22). It also ensures that the president has widespread support throughout the nation, not just in populated cities or regions.\\n\\nGiven that the method of election profoundly affects the campaigning process and policy prioritization of candidates, I urge you to consider these benefits of the Electoral College system carefully.\\n\\nIn closing, while the process may be complex and sometimes result in a disconnect between the popular vote and the ultimate winner, it is important to recognize that the Electoral College was designed with the intent of ensuring broader representation and preventing a tyranny of the majority.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your Name]The Electoral College should be not be abolished and the government should not change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. The Electoral College requires the presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal, it produces a clear winner and avoids runoff elections, and the Electoral College allows people in swing states to be more thoughtful and choose wisely because the popular vote could be in their hands.\\n\\nIn Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , it states, \"The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" This means that the favorite candidate of a particular region has no reason to campaign too much in those states because that candidate doesn\\'t gain many more votes. Any candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be successful because the people of the other region feel that their interests will be overlooked by the president.\\n\\nThe Electoral College decreases the amount of pressure of a runoff election. In paragraph twentytwo of the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, it states, \"The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.\" So if both presidential candidates receive an equal percent of of popular votes, the Electoral College\\'s number of votes could be the \"game changer.\" The number of votes in the Electoral College produces a clear winner. If there wasn\\'t an Electoral College, then there would have to be a recount of votes and one vote could change the entire election. This could cause chaos in swing states because of the one vote of someone that might not even care who wins the election.\\n\\nBased on many elections, the Electoral College creates more thoughtful voters in swing states. Those people know that the power of turning an election around is in their hands, so they must use that knowledge wisely, not recklessly. People in nonswing states will vote on a candidate that their peers like or that they heard is \"the best\" even though it may actually be a choice reconsidered two years into the winning candidates presidency. In paragraph twenty of the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , it states, \"Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competeing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election.\" The most careful voters should be the ones to decide because they are the ones receiving the most attention by candidates trying to persuade them to vote for them.\\n\\nOverall, the Electoral College should not be abolished and the government should not change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. The Electoral College doesn\\'t allow a presidential candidate to have a single regional appeal, it produces a clear and fair winner and avoids runoff elections, and the Electoral College creates more thoughtful and careful voters, because when you actually think choices through in life, it could make a tremendous impact on yourself everyone around you.Limiting car usage has several advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This practice has been adopted by various communities around the world, such as Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia. These communities have implemented measures to separate suburban life from the use of cars, and the results have been overwhelmingly positive. By limiting car usage, these communities have reduced greenhouse gas emissions, decreased traffic congestion, and promoted healthier and more sustainable lifestyles.\\n\\nOne of the major benefits of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, they contribute to 12 percent of these emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the number goes up to 50 percent. By limiting car usage, as demonstrated in Vauban and Paris, these communities have successfully reduced their carbon footprint and contributed to the fight against climate change. This is crucial in the face of the global environmental crisis.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can effectively decrease traffic congestion in suburban areas. Suburbs are often heavily dependent on cars, leading to congested roads and long commuting times. However, by implementing measures like car-free zones and promoting alternative transportation options, such as walking, biking, and public transport, communities can alleviate this problem. Vauban, for example, has shown that by limiting cars and promoting cycling and walking, the community has created a peaceful and traffic-free environment, allowing residents to enjoy the true essence of suburbia.\\n\\nIn addition to the environmental and traffic benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. The availability of public transportation and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure in these communities encourages people to rely less on cars and engage in more physical activities. This promotes exercise, reduces sedentary behavior, and improves overall health and well-being. Studies have shown that people who walk or bike for transportation have lower rates of obesity and chronic diseases compared to those who rely solely on cars. By limiting car usage, communities are not only promoting a cleaner environment but also prioritizing the health and well-being of their residents.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and communities. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, decreases traffic congestion, promotes healthier lifestyles, and creates more sustainable environments. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate that implementing measures to separate suburban life from the use of cars can lead to positive outcomes. It is crucial for more communities to adopt these practices in order to create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future.In todays society driving or riding in a car is a completely normal activity. You drive to school, work, extracurricular activities, social gatherings, and everything else that doesnt happen in your own home. Cars are a part of everyday life.\\n\\nWhat if I told you that there a cities that are banning car usage? Vauban in Germany is a suburb that has given up cars. Paris banned driving for a few days to reduce smog. bogota, Columbia initiated an annual \"carfree day.\" Cities all over the world are giving up cars and looking to other forms of transportation. So why limit car usage? Well, the usage of cars produces Ozone harming greenhousee gas emissions, smog, traffic jams, and addsstress to the our everyday lives.\\n\\nA large amount of the harmful greenhousee gas emissions that surroundthe earth come directly from cars. Accordingto source 1 \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhousee gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.\" By ending the use of even a fraction of our car usage we would drastically improve the amount of gas emissions produced. This improvement would mean healthier air and a healthier Ozone.\\n\\nIn Paris, France pollution and smog is a big problem. Source 2 states that Paris has much more smog than other European capital cities. \"Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london.\" Because of this intense smog Paris created a partial driving ban policy to help clear and clean the city air. The policy stated that on Monday vehicles with an evenmumbered lincense plate would have to leave their cars at their home or be issued a 22euro fine. The next day this rule would apply to oddnumbered licence plates. As a result to this partial ban the city smog and congestion levels decreased by 60 percent. Even this partial change benefited the city greatly by reducing smog and poor air quality.\\n\\nOne growing trend in some cities in South America is \"carfree day.\" Source 3describes how \"cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted.\" The objective of this day is to anchorage the usage of public transportation. This day was \"a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\" according to one businessman by the name of Carlos Arturo Plaza. He is right. Cars are an added stress to a busy day. While driving there is a constant fear of being involved in an accident, getting lost, popping a tire, or having your car break down. There is also the nuisance of heavy stopandgo traffic, bad drivers, and uncooperative lights. When the amount of cars on the road is reduced there are less bad drivers, less traffic jams, and less stress. That also means that safety is improved so there are less accidents.\\n\\nBy limiting their car usage many cities have improved their environments and their lives. In all these cities greenhouse gas levels are reduced, the smog levels in Paris have fallen, safety in these cities has improved, and the stress of transportation has become less of an issue. With all of these advantages is there really a question why these cities have been limiting car usage? When you think aboutthe advantages of reducingprivate transportation these vehicle bans make perfect sense.Senator (Name),\\n\\nI write to you concerning a topic of great debate that has come to impact the way our democratic society expresses its voice - the Electoral College system. Developed by our founding fathers as a compromise between a congressional selection and a popular vote, the Electoral College system, while imperfect, offers balance and guards against potential disaster.\\n\\nCritics of the system often argue that it is significantly undemocratic. Indeed, Bradford Plumer, in his text \"The Indefensible Electoral College\" points out that the voters vote for electors rather than directly for the president. However, Judge Richard A. Posner, an advocate of the Electoral college, argues that such a feature offers a degree of security and stability - \"a dispute over the Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote\". Given that almost all states adopt a winner-take-all approach to their electoral votes, even a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide of votes, reducing the likelihood of conflict.\\n\\nThose opposing the Electoral College claim that its \\'winner-take-all\\' system alienates candidates from \\'sure\\' states and disenfranchises voters. While it may be true to some degree that candidates tend to focus more on swing states, this in itself encourages a greater level of engagement and thoughtfulness from voters, whom Posner regards as \"the most thoughtful voters”.\\n\\nIn a departure from standard democratic methods, the current design of the Electoral College allows for a clear and definite outcome avoiding complicated run-off elections that would occur in the event of no candidate receiving a majority of popular votes. As Posner cites, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 won with only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, similar situations could be problematic under direct voting.\\n\\nOne common criticism regards ‘faithless electors’, those who defy the will of the people and vote against their state’s popular vote. However, this remains a rare occurrence, and safeguards can be put into place to limit such incidents, including binding legislation or penalties.\\n\\nHowever, this shouldn\\'t prevent us from looking at potential reforms like the introduction of the proportional representation system used in Maine and Nebraska throughout the states. This could keep the benefits of the Electoral College while mitigating the potential biased effectiveness of \\'winner-takes-all\\' approach and addressing the concerns of those favoring a more directly democratic method.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the Electoral College may initially appear outdated or non-democratic, it provides a valuable buffer against electoral conflict and complexity, ensures candidates appeal beyond regional boundaries, and produces a stable and definitive outcome. But it\\'s not untouchable and should be open to improvement and modernization in order to keep up with the evolution of our society and democratic values.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Cars have been around for over hundred years. They caused some good and bad things. People use cars daily to go places. Now days people have not been using their cars that much. Some advantages, from some texts, of limiting car usage is there will be less car emissions, and less traffic.\\n\\nTo begin with there will be less car emissions. Ever since the first car rolled off the assembly line they have been polluting the air. As seen here \"Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter\" Duffer. From all the cars and trucks that Paris has, they have the most emissions in their air. Another example will be \"Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France\" Duffer. From experance working on cars the diesel engine give off the most pollution out of all the vehicles on the roads today. Since the air in France was getting to bad they had to \"Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31\" Duffer. The smog got so bad in the air that France had to take a good amount of drivers off the roads to reduce their emissions so the smog will be reduced. As a result from parking those drivers \"Almost 4,000 drivers were fined\" Duffer. Today, cars are assories and people need their cars to go to work and cannot blame those people for doing what they had to do. One last example is \"If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\" Rosenthal. Since people are using cars less the pollution in the air will decrease. The emissions had gotten to bad and its hurting our Earth.\\n\\nLastly is there will be less traffic on the streets. Lately people have not been getting their drivers license.\"A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009\" Rosenthal. The newer generation does not have the desire to drive and to work on cars like the generation before them. Another example is \"As a result, 70 percent of vaughn\\'s families do not own cars, and 57 percent were sold\" Rosenthal. 70 percent is a high number of people and that is a lot of people that are not on the roads. Since those people are in Germany this is what happen in France \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France\" Duffer. That is a huge decrease in traffic there will be no problems getting anywhere on time. Another key example is \"People park their cars in large garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home\" Rosenthal. Since people do not have the money to pay for a parking spot they have to get rid of their cars and that will definatly clear up the roads. One last example is \"vaughn\\'s streets are completey \\'carfree\\' except the main drag to down town\" Rosenthal. vaughn\\'s street are compleatly empty now hows that for no traffic.\\n\\nIn closing, cars have been around for a while now. They caused some problems and no problems. People use cars to go places daily. Now days people have not been using their cars that much. Some advantages, from some texts, of limiting car usage is there will be less car emissions, and less traffic.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[State Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections\\n\\nDear [State Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and advocate against the idea of changing to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College plays a crucial role in maintaining our democratic process and upholding the principles on which our founding fathers established this nation.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. With the winner-take-all system, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, providing a clear and decisive outcome. As witnessed in the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. This system minimizes the likelihood of a disputed election and provides a stable framework for the American people.\\n\\nAnother important aspect of the Electoral College is that it ensures that every region of the country has a say in the presidential election. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This forces candidates to campaign across the nation, appealing to voters from different backgrounds and perspectives. It ensures that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to win the presidency and that all Americans feel represented in the highest office.\\n\\nFurthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This system gives a voice to the most thoughtful voters who are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. It prevents candidates from solely focusing on populous states and neglecting the concerns and issues of smaller states.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also balances the political power between large and small states. The system restores weight to large states that may otherwise lose their influence due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. For instance, in the 2012 election, Florida, with its close popular vote, received 29 electoral votes, while a comparable victory in Wyoming would only yield 3 electoral votes. This balance allows candidates to address the concerns of both small and large states, ensuring a more equitable representation of the American people.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In scenarios where no candidate secures a majority in the popular vote, the Electoral College guarantees the selection of a clear winner. Run-off elections would complicate the presidential election process and may lead to further division among the electorate. The Electoral College acts as a safeguard to ensure a definite outcome and avoid prolonged electoral disputes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic process. It facilitates certainty of outcome, represents the interests of all regions and states, encourages candidates to campaign widely, balances the political power between large and small states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. While some argue for a popular vote system, it is essential to remember that the Electoral College has served us well for over two centuries and maintains the integrity of our elections.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages of the Electoral College in making decisions regarding this matter. I am confident that upholding the Electoral College will ensure a fair and representative election process for future generations of Americans.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]What would you do if you got written a ticket by a police officer for just driving your car? It could happen if we had a day that driving was banned to help the environment. I think this is great idea and we shold all get involved with trying to make it work. Other countries have done it and it doesn\\'t seem to effect anybody negatively. The only thing this would do is limit the pollution put off in America and all over.\\n\\nCars are probably the biggest source of pollution in our world today. We use cars for everything now and it is very convenient but have you ever really thought of what they are doing to our atmosphere and ozone. Smog is one of the biggest effects from driving and its not a pretty one. I wouldn\\'t want my city to be covered in a thick layer of foggy gas fuems. In paris the smog was so thick they had to make driving outlawed for a few days just to keep it under control. If we did it even just a couple times a year nation wide it could really help.\\n\\nIn columbia they tried this to help with car emissions and everybody enjoyed it. They even said other countries joined in so I think its our turn to give it a try.\\n\\nThe people of Vauban, Germany have a pretty much car free town. If towns started going car free like this in America the emissions would drop greatly. In Vauban evrybody really likes not needing cars and say it is much less stressful than driving everyday. If just one in every 20 cities of the United States went car free we would notice how much cleaner the air is and the greenhouse effect or global warming would be almost nonexistent.\\n\\nAnother thing the articles mentioned is hybrid cars. I think hybrid cars are great, I personally have one, but some people don\\'t really understand or like them. These cars could really help save the environment in just a few years if people were to start only using them. Which I doubt will happen but they still are driven by many people and its much better then everyone driving a diesel truck around all the time.\\n\\nIn all honesty I don\\'t think any of this will happen here anytime soon but it sure would be nice. The greenhouse effect is very real no matter how many people argue about it and there is thigs that can be done to help prevent it. We just have to be willing to make some sacrafices to save our planet.Believe it or not there are ways people may be harming the environment without actually knowing it. If you really think about it though there are many ways you can help prevent harm to the environment. One of them is limiting car usage. The advantages to giving limits to this could be very helpful to restoring our world.\\n\\nA city in Germany has gone the extra mile to solve problems due to car use. What the residents of Vauban, an upscale suburban community have done is, they have all given up their cars. Street parking, driveways, and garages are not allowed. The only way to park is to buy a parking spot along with your home for 40,000. Because of this movement 70 percent of families there do not own cars and 57 percent sold theirs to move to Vauban. A media trainer and mother of two said that when she had a car she was always tense but now is much happier. This no car movement is called \"smart planning\". A reason it started is because studies have shown that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in america. The basic ideas from Vauban are being adopted around the world attempting to make suburbs more compact with less space for parking. Now in the US many agencies are promoting car reduced communities. Also legislators are starting to act. Many say public transport in suburbs will play a much larger role in a new 6 year federal transportation bill to be approved this year. More suburbs like this one could change the world.\\n\\nIn Paris there had been days of nearrecord pollution. To help clear the city\\'s air Paris enforced a partial driving ban. Monday, motorists with even numbered liscence plates were forced to leave their cars at home or pay a 31 fine. Rejecting the fine resulted in having your car impounded. As a result 60 percent of congestion was down in France\\'s capitol. The smog due to car usage was cleared enough on monday to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates the next day. In Columbia a similar day is taken place every year. A car free day where people hiked, biked, skated and took buses to work instead of driving their cars. If you violated this you would be fined 25. Even in rainy weather people participated just to help lower stress and air pollution. This campaign has sparked a revolution. It has also created the construction of 118 miles of bike paths, parks, and sports centers. It has caused the replacement of pitted sidewalks with broad smooth ones, cut traffic, and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have appeared. If every country had a day like this we could make a unbelievable difference.\\n\\nAccording to recent studies Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer liscences each year. Even though America has basically been the birthplace of cars and is one of the world\\'s prime car cultures its love seems to be cooling down. The number of miles driven in the US peaked in 2005 and steadily declined in the years following. In april 2009 the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below its peak and equal to where it was in 1995. Part of the problem has most definitely been recession but as the economy recovers the decrease in driving has not changed. According to a research proffessor at University Of Michigan car ownership per household started to lower two to three years before the downturn. If this trend persists it will have benificial implications for carbon emmissions and the environment. One of the things causing this is the internet which allows people to feel more connected to eachother without driving to meet friends. Also people carpooling and biking have helped. There has been a large drop in peoples age 1620 getting their liscence. They organize summer jobs and their social lives around where they can walk or take public transportation, or carpool. Between 2001 and 2009 driving by young people decreased 23 percent. All of this helps conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.\\n\\nIn conclusion there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Many communities have taken part of this trend and it is rapidly being recognized around the world. Taking part in this helps the community and environment. Anyone can do it.Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities alike. This is evident in the experiences of communities around the world, as described in the passages provided. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can address critical issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, as well as create safer and more sustainable communities.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Cars are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in areas where car usage is high. For example, in Europe, cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this figure can reach up to 50 percent (Passage 5). By reducing car usage, we can help combat climate change and work towards a more sustainable future.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality. In cities like Paris, smog can become a major problem, causing health issues for residents. To combat this, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to reduce smog levels, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion (Passage 10, 14). Similar efforts have been made in other cities, such as Bogota, where car-free days have been implemented to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation (Passage 21).\\n\\nIn addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on public health and safety. In communities where cars are restricted, residents are more likely to engage in physical activities like walking or biking, leading to improved fitness levels and overall well-being. Moreover, by reducing car usage, we can create safer streets with fewer accidents and fatalities. In Vauban, Germany, where car usage is limited, residents report feeling happier and less tense without the constant presence of cars (Passage 3).\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for more efficient and compact community planning. By reducing the need for parking spaces, communities can allocate more land for other purposes, such as parks or public transportation infrastructure. In Vauban, stores are placed a walk away on a main street, providing residents with easy access to necessities without the need for a car (Passage 6). This type of planning can create more vibrant and accessible communities that prioritize pedestrians and public transportation over cars.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can address environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, improve public health and safety, and create more efficient and sustainable communities. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the positive impacts of limiting car usage and highlight the potential for change in our own communities. It is clear that by prioritizing alternative transportation methods and adopting smart planning strategies, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.My fellow citizens, allow me to make an urgent announcement. Stop with the constant use of cars. It\\'s damaging not only us, but the environment. We live in world where cars are now becoming a major trend, and we\\'re driving them more and more. If we keep drawing that pattern, we won\\'t have a stable world to live in.\\n\\nI\\'m not saying to completely stop using your vehicles, although we might see a larger change than expected, what I\\'m saying is to manage your car usage wisely. Every time we pick up the keys, start our engine and take off to the nearest grocery store, we add a larger threat to the environment. In paris Bans Driving Due To smog by Robert Duffer, it informs of the enforcement France is taking to clean up it\\'s polluted cities. Duffer shows us how \"the smog\" that invades the city became a rival to Beijing, China, which is known as the most polluted cities in the world. Imagine going outside to see the beautiful sun, and instead open the door to cars delivering blinding \"smog.\" We can\\'t allow ourselves to become the most polluted cities, and the first step is to manage ourselves with our cars.\\n\\nThere\\'s some of us who suffer from stress and anxiety. There\\'s some of us who look at our community and are probably never wanting to go outside again. That is not a community to live in. We deserve to feel relieved, relaxed, and renewed from time to time. In carFree Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit in bogota by Andrew Selsky, it demonstrates a perfect example. Selsky writes about a \"CarFree\" day in Bogota, Columbia, and a man shares his side of this event. Carlos Arturo Plaza tells us, \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polluton.\" Selsky writes in paragraph 28 the benefits of this event. He writes, \"Parks and sport centers bloomed... Dramatically cut traffic... New restaurants and shopping districts developed.\" Look what we can accomplish from not using our cars as much.\\n\\nWe\\'re in a time where money is the top priority in our lives. All those gas prices, and the car insurance car owners must pay is ridiculous. Sometimes people can\\'t even sleep at night due to all the thinking of \"how will I pay this?\", or \"how will I pay that?\" It later becomes a constant battle. This is when technology comes in handy. Now with the common \"Facebook\" and other social media, we\\'re able to connect more and more. It\\'s sad to see people waste their money going to a friends house for probably an hour or so, when they can just talk virtually. Elisabeth Rosenthal, writer of \\'The End of Car Culture,\\' most likely will agree with me. Rosenthal inputs Mimi Sheller\\'s say in all this. Sheller is a sociology professor at Drexel University, and she cites important factors on paragraph 35. \"Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends.\" Why drive and pay for gas when you can get on the web? You\\'ll be glad you did.\\n\\nNow, many will be able to disagree with me saying that, \"we need cars to drive long distances,\" or, \"I rather pay and have my own privacy then be with twenty people I don\\'t know on a bus.\" That\\'s fine. I\\'m not saying to wipe out the fact that you have a car, all I\\'m saying is to use it wisely. Drive long distances, not short ones that can take you ten minutes to walk. \"What about the people who work in car companies?\" Well, if we all followed what Bogota is doing and develop shopping districts and renewal companies, I\\'m sure there will be many jobs available. No matter the pay, you\\'ll still have no worry about your automobile bills, which will help you save a huge amount of money. We need to save ourselves from driving and polluting the earth, or else we won\\'t have a great life to live. Blinding smog will cover the sky, and many won\\'t be able to enjoy the rich outside there once was. All we will see are streets instead of parks. We need to stop ourselves from driving too much in order to live to the fullest.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[State Senator\\'s Name]\\n[State Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections\\n\\nDear [State Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in the United States presidential elections and urge you to consider the benefits it provides to our democracy. While there is an ongoing debate regarding whether to keep the Electoral College or change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial aspect of our democratic process that should be preserved.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in presidential elections. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate\\'s share of the electoral votes consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election outcome. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also contributes to this, as even a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory, minimizing the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of having a president who represents the entire nation. By requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign and gain support in various regions of the country. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on regions where they are already popular and ensures that they consider the interests of citizens from all regions. It fosters a sense of national unity by giving every region a stake in the election.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the Electoral College system is its focus on swing states. In a close election, where the outcome depends on a few states, candidates are more likely to pay attention to and campaign in these swing states. This results in more informed and engaged voters in these states, who carefully evaluate the competing candidates. This heightened attention helps in making thoughtful decisions and serves the democratic process by ensuring that swing state voters have a significant say in the election.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also brings balance to the political influence of large and small states. By awarding electoral votes based on the number of congressional representatives and senators, large states have a greater weight in the electoral process. This balance is important as it prevents the interests and concerns of large states from completely overpowering smaller states. Through this system, candidates are incentivized to address the needs of a diverse range of states, not just those with the largest populations.\\n\\nFinally, the Electoral College ensures a clear winner and avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College guarantees that a clear winner emerges. The pressure for a run-off election, which significantly complicates the election process, is thus diminished. This leads to a more efficient and streamlined election outcome.\\n\\nWhile I acknowledge the criticisms against the Electoral College, including the focus on swing states and the potential for a candidate to lose the popular vote but still win the presidency, I believe the benefits outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College maintains a level of stability, promotes national unity, and prevents the political interests of certain regions from dominating the election process.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe in the importance and efficacy of the Electoral College system in our presidential elections. It upholds the principles of our democratic system by ensuring a certainty of outcome, representing the entire nation, giving swing states a significant influence, providing balance between large and small states, and avoiding run-off elections. I urge you to consider these points and support the retention of the Electoral College.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your support in preserving this vital component of our democracy.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]To all my fellow citizens, I must tell you about all the spectacular things cities are doing. They have started giving up their cars to decrease the congestion and pollution rate. The cities that have already tried it have seen a huge benefit.\\n\\nA little community in Vauban, Germany was the fist city to let go of their cars. Residents say they feel much less stress than when they had cars. What a surprise that not having to worry about traffic would reduce stress. It has also drastically reduced tailpipe emissions. They\\'re have been rearangments by stores, they have been relocated along public sidewalks so that people no longer hae to drive across town to the mall or stores. They can simply walk or bike down the road to pick up whatever might interest them.\\n\\nThe next place that picked up this amazing wonderful idea was none other than the busiest city in France Paris. Paris ordered its citizens to leave their car at home, and if they didn\\'t comply would pay a 22euro fine. 4000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to this fine, but if I was able to buy a car and not drive then I would be among those who would have their car impounded. On the bright side congestion went down 60% which is amazing for one of the busiest cities in the world.\\n\\nThe next place thats wanting to pick up this no car trend is none other than right here in the United States, and were supporting it. Each year that goes by recent studies have suggest that Americans aren\\'t buying as many cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. If this pattern progresses it could solve our atmosphere problem. If huge cities and like Paris,Vauban,and The United States will give up cars. Than that alone could drastically change the path that our planet is headed for.\\n\\nSo citizens I hope this encourages you to cut back on your car usage. Take the bike out every once and a while or just walk. Whats the worst that could happen if you limited your automobile usage.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[State Senator\\'s Name]\\n[State Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nDear [State Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my position on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in the election process for the President of the United States. After careful consideration and examination of multiple viewpoints, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College system rather than changing to a popular vote system. The Electoral College serves several important purposes, including providing a certainty of outcome, promoting regional inclusivity, focusing campaign efforts, balancing power between large and small states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome it provides. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome is significantly reduced, offering stability and avoiding prolonged disputes over the popular vote. In an already complex electoral process, a clear outcome is essential for maintaining public trust and confidence in our democracy.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions of the country. As Judge Posner points out, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning candidates must have trans-regional appeal. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on highly populated urban centers or densely populated regions, but instead take into account the concerns and interests of diverse populations across the nation. This inclusivity fosters a sense of unity among different regions and prevents the presidency from becoming dominated by a few states or regions.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states or toss-up states where the outcome is less certain. This prompts candidates to not only pay attention to the concerns of these states but also actively engage with voters and address their specific needs. This focus on swing states leads to a more informed and engaged electorate as voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. The Electoral College system, therefore, promotes a greater degree of voter participation and thoughtful decision-making.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to balance the power between large and small states. As Judge Posner highlights, the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose due to Senate mal-apportionment. By giving each state a number of electoral votes based on its population, the system ensures that presidential candidates cannot solely rely on the support of heavily populated states. This recognition of smaller states\\' interests prevents elections from being dominated by highly populous regions or urban centers, ensuring that the voices of rural and less-populated areas are also heard and their concerns addressed.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College system avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This not only simplifies the electoral process but also saves time and resources. Without the Electoral College, our election process could become more complex and prone to prolonged campaigns, which can be costly and may hinder the smooth functioning of our democratic system. The current system, by consistently producing a clear winner, ensures a smooth transition and allows the President to govern with a mandate from the electoral majority.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College system serves important purposes in our democracy. It provides a certainty of outcome, promotes regional inclusivity, focuses campaign efforts, balances power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. Although there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as the winner-take-all system and the perception of some voters that their votes may not count, the benefits of the system outweigh these concerns. Therefore, I urge you to consider the importance of these advantages and support the retention of the Electoral College.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust that you will carefully consider the information presented in this letter. I hope that you will support the continuation of the Electoral College as it has served our nation well for over two centuries.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]If we never do anything about the air pollution coming from cars will the human race last a long time? If you had to choose from killing yourself slowly or making the world healthier by walking instead of taking a car what would you choose? Many people don\\'t understand the damage that driving all of the time is doing to our world. But, limiting car usage has many advantages that come along with it.\\n\\nLimiting car usage come along with many advantages. One advantage of limiting car usage is that you can limit the amount of smog that goes into the air and also into your lungs. In source 2 it says, \"After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine31.\" That is a very good choice of action because without hearing that they would have any consequences people still would have drove their cars. In source 2 it also says, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...\" So, by limiting car usage just by the even numbered license plates there was less smog in just one day. In source 2 it says, \"The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday.\" So, the success of just one day made people want to do it a second day with just the oddnumbered license plates. If they keep this up and eventually have a day where neither odd nor even numbered license plates can drive the smog will eventually clear all the way up.\\n\\nAlso, another advantage to limiting car usage is there won\\'t be many traffic jams. In source 3 it says, \"In a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams,\" meaning that everyone got around easily without all of the congestion in the roads. In source 3 it also says, \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" said the businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife.\" Traffic jams tend to cause alot of people stress. People stress because they can\\'t get to important places on time, they spend hours on the same highway, etc. By limiting car usage, they limit their stress and have a good day instead of being so angry just because of traffic which will help them out in the long run because alot of stress isn\\'t good for the body.\\n\\nThere are many more advantages to limiting car usage. In source 4 it says, \"pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\" By just taking the little time to figure out a different, less polluting way of transportation all of these advantages come out of it.\\n\\nMany people don\\'t understand the damage that driving all of the time is doing to our world. But, limiting car usage has many advantages that come along with it. A way that I could pitch in would be to ride the school bus with everybody else instead of driving myself to school. Some advantages to that would be using less gas, saving money and carpooling so that there are less cars on the road and less air pollution, because we need the air to stay clean so we can breathe and stay alive. So by limiting car usage we can have many good things happen to our lives and to our world.Dear State Senator, While I understand that the Electoral College has worked sufficiently up until this point, it may not always work well enough to keep America sustained for the rest of its lifetime. The electoral college is unnecessarily complicated and the more steps you take heightens the chance of error. I acknowledge the fact that discrepancies in the current voting system are highly unlikely, but they have happened before and who says they won\\'t happen again? I don\\'t know why voting has to jump through so many hoops to make it count. It\\'s indirect and the votes could be messed up at numerous different points. The Electoral College is an unjust form of democracy and it needs to be changed.\\n\\nUnder our voting system voters votes do not actually count for the candidate that they voted for, rather a slate of electors who then vote for the candidates themselves. Having the slate of electors is like blanketing them: you can hear them and you know that they\\'re there but you can\\'t understand what they really want. Take the election of 2000 for an example. Al Gore had more votes among the people but Bush won the presidency because the Electoral College accurately represented the people. If America was truly a democracy, Al Gore would have been president because the people would have actually been heard. If the people could actually have a say in the way that America is run, most people would choose to abolish the Electoral College.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is unreliable. It could come to a tie in any election and then the House of Representatives would step in and make scales tip even further. Each state casts only one vote and I find that ridiculous. Why would each state only get one vote? I think that the states should get a proportionate number of votes to their population. There is no reason why 500,000 voters should be weighed the same as 35,000,000 voters. The people voting do not get represented fairly whatsoever.\\n\\nA direct democracy would be a better fit for America so there wouldn\\'t be so many discrepancies to how the people fit in. The people would the voice that America claims they have. The people in swing states should not be the only ones deciding who the president is because it\\'s not fair. What about the people in the red or blue states? Do they just get silenced completely? The people need to be heard. Make america about the people.Limiting car usage offers numerous advantages that can greatly benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This approach not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate air pollution, but it also promotes healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. Several examples from around the world demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage.\\n\\nOne such example is the town of Vauban in Germany, where residents have given up their cars. Streets in the town are completely car-free, except for a few essential thoroughfares. As a result, 70% of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their cars to move to this car-free community. The absence of cars has created a peaceful environment, with the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children replacing the noise of car engines. Vauban is part of a growing trend in Europe and the United States to separate suburban life from car use, as a component of \"smart planning.\"\\n\\nThe advantages of limiting car usage extend beyond improved quality of life. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. In Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this figure can reach up to 50%. By reducing car usage, we can drastically reduce these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change. Additionally, limiting car usage can also help address air pollution issues, which are particularly severe in major cities like Paris. Implementing driving bans, like the one enforced in Paris due to smog, can significantly reduce congestion and improve air quality.\\n\\nPromoting alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, is an important aspect of limiting car usage. Initiatives like car-free days, as seen in Bogota, Colombia, encourage people to use alternative methods of transportation, leading to a significant decrease in traffic congestion. Public transportation systems play a vital role in reducing car dependence and promoting accessibility. Efforts are being made worldwide to make suburbs more compact and suitable for walking, with stores located within walking distance rather than being distant and car-dependent. These smart planning strategies aim to create communities that are less reliant on cars, helping to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and promote physical activity and healthier lifestyles.\\n\\nThe decrease in car usage is not solely attributed to economic factors, such as the recession. Sociologists suggest that cultural shifts, driven by factors like urban renewal, advancements in technology, and changing preferences of younger generations, play a significant role in the decline. Young people, in particular, are becoming less interested in car ownership and prioritize alternative forms of transportation. As the next generation begins to make lifestyle choices that align with sustainability and environmental consciousness, the decline in car culture is expected to continue.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, decreased traffic congestion, and promotion of healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. Examples from around the world, such as Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia, demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage in creating more livable and environmentally-friendly communities. By embracing alternative forms of transportation and implementing smart planning strategies, we can pave the way for a future with reduced car dependence and a healthier planet.A day without driving your car? who can\\'t do that. Also making the Earth a better place to live? awesome! Taking advantage of a limiting car using its a great idea because people are lowering air pollution and there\\'s no more rushhour. Getting stuck in traffic isn\\'t pretty nice and most likely if you have a meeting your going to be late. Also people just dont want to own cars anymore.\\n\\nTo start off, I like the idea that people are limiting their car usage because people are lowering air pollution. In source 2, the author explains \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog.. rivaled in Beijing, China, Which is known as one of the most polluted cites in the world.\" This means that cars are bad for the environment they had to decrease the number of cars so they could stop the smog because they didn\\'t wanted to end up like china. But however, not using cars is affecting car industry like it states in source 4 \"since ttransportation is the second larges source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implication for the car industry.\" Never the less, air pollution is the main problem like in source 3 in Bogota \"The goal is to promote alternative ttransportation and reduce smog.\" The reason they are doing this is for people to find another way to get to their destination and to reduce smog as it states.\\n\\nFurthermore, I like the idea that people are limiting their car usage because there\\'s no more rushhour. avoiding traffic is great like in source 3 \" Bogota, Colombia In a program that\\'s spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or tok buses to work during a carfree day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic.\" colombians do this to avoid traffic and its a cool way because you could ride bikes and skated. likewise in source 4 some Children don\\'t get their driver license its not because they\\'re lazy it\\'s because they don\\'t need them, yeah they come in handy but they\\'re not interseted for example in source 4 they stated \"They organized their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends.\" having a car isn\\'t a teenager main interest, they rather walk to a close by place or car pool with their friends.\\n\\nTo sum up, in my opinion I think limiting car usage is a great idea because less air pollution, rushhour, and some people just don\\'t want to own cars.We should not keep the Electoral college because first, it\\'s unfair, and also, it can quickly turn into a disaster.\\n\\nTo begin with, the Electoral college is an unfair system. In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , \" Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.\"Plumer, p10.When voters vote for the Electoral college the person they put in might not even vote for who the people want for the President. The system is not only unfair when people vote, also when campaigns happen in states. In paragraph 13 of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , the author states \"Because of the winnertakesall system... candidates don\\'t spend time in states they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.\". With this system, we have some states that are left out of the campaign of candidates going through states, because they are not important to the candidate for winning.\\n\\nIn addition, not only is the Electoral college unfair, the system can fail at any given election. Plumer wrote in paragraph 11 \"...what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress.\" the Electoral college is only to have one slate of electors from each state. With two slates from one state it would give both the state and the candidate an advantage over the rest of the states and the other candidate, that would turn into a disaster. Not only can the states destory the Electoral college system, the system can destory itself. Included in paragraph 12, \" The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.\". Even the people put into the college can ruin themselves by one or two electoral voters changing their minds.\\n\\nNot everything about the Electoral college is bad. The article In the Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our reasons despised method of choosing the President said, \"..it\\'s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.\"Posner, p18. Even the other vote systems are strongly disliked. The Electoral system is not the most disliked system but it can also get the President everyone wants. In paragraph 19,\"... a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\". A candidate for the president can\\'t focus on one region, because it will make other states feel that they are not important.\\n\\nFinally, the Electoral college should no longer exist because, it\\'s an unfair system and can quickly turn into a catastrophe.In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in various parts of the world. This change is being driven by the realization that cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and are contributing to climate change. By reducing car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, we can not only reduce our carbon footprint but also improve our quality of life.\\n\\nOne example of a car-free community is Vauban, Germany. In this upscale suburb, residents are not allowed to park their cars on the streets or in their driveways. Instead, they have to park in large garages on the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of the families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of them actually sold their cars to move there. Vauban is an example of how suburban life can be separated from auto use, and it is part of a larger movement called \"smart planning.\" This movement aims to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking.\\n\\nThe advantages of limiting car usage are numerous. First and foremost, doing so helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and slow down the progression of climate change.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In cities like Paris, where smog has become a major issue, partial driving bans have been implemented to reduce air pollution. During these bans, only cars with specific license plate numbers are allowed on the road, while others face fines for driving. These measures have been effective in reducing congestion and improving air quality. By implementing similar measures in other cities, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for our citizens.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to a more active and healthier population. In Bogota, Colombia, the city has implemented a car-free day, where cars are banned from the streets and alternative forms of transportation are encouraged. This event has been successful in promoting biking, walking, and public transportation, and has helped to reduce traffic jams and increase physical activity levels among citizens. By limiting car usage, we can create cities that are more walkable and bike-friendly, leading to healthier and happier communities.\\n\\nIn addition to these advantages, limiting car usage also has economic benefits. By reducing the reliance on cars, we can invest in and improve public transportation systems. This can make commuting more efficient and affordable for everyone. It can also help to reduce traffic congestion, which is a major issue in many urban areas. By investing in public transportation and creating more compact and walkable communities, we can improve the overall quality of life for our citizens.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. By reducing our reliance on cars and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote physical activity, and create more efficient and sustainable communities. It is clear that limiting car usage is a crucial step in combating climate change and creating a better future for ourselves and future generations.Dear State Senator, The Electoral College has been here since the founders of this country put it in our Constitution to please both sides. This Electoral College has made a lot of history in our great nation and we appreciate what it has done for us. It\\'s a huge part of our election process but is time we move on from it. Their have been to many instances where a presidential candidate has had the popular vote but has lost because he didn\\'t have enough electoral votes. \"It happened in 200, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888\" source 3 This may have not happened more than twice but this could easily happen again and cause a catastrophe. This is why I disapprove of the electoral college.\\n\\nThis process is also unfair to voters because when they vote for a president they are really voting for electors. The electors can be any citizen so the voters don\\'t know who the electors are. Voters can rarely decide who the electors vote for which puts them at a disadvantage and is an inconvience for the voters. \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president\" source 2.\\n\\nThere has been several of organizations and people who have tried to get the electoral college deleted from election processes including...\" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO\" Source 2. These are multiple people with proven track records and are some of many who are ready for change. The electoral college has brought good and bad to our country but there are times when things should be left in the past.\\n\\nUsing the popular vote as the one and only way of electing presidents is needed in this country. The choice of presidents should be soley up to the american people. There should be no electoral college that can totally change the outcome of a election because one candidate doesent have enough electoral votes. In my eyes it appears the electoral college has slightly to much impact on the outcome of the election. Imagine running for president and you when the hearts of the voters with popular votes but happen to lost the election because you didn\\'t have enough electoral votes. How would you feel about the electoral college after that experience? This is why there is a need for change in the electoral college. Save candidates from losing an election that they should have one but didn\\'t because they didn\\'t have enough electoral votes.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage can have many advantages for individuals and society as a whole. By reducing reliance on cars, we can improve our environment, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create healthier, more sustainable communities.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. According to a study mentioned in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. This is particularly important in today\\'s world where global warming is becoming a major concern.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to cleaner air and less pollution. The passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution highlights the impact that cars have on air quality. Diesel fuel, which is commonly used in cars, is a major contributor to air pollution. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and create a healthier environment for everyone.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative modes of transportation. The passage about Bogota\\'s car-free day demonstrates how people can hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work instead of driving. Encouraging these alternative modes of transportation not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes physical activity and healthier lifestyles. In addition, it can lead to the development of more accessible and efficient public transportation systems, making it easier for people to get around without a car.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can also have positive social and economic impacts. The passage about Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, highlights how giving up cars can lead to less stress and happier lives for residents. It also mentions how stores are placed within walking distance, creating a more compact and connected community. By reducing car dependency, we can create more livable and vibrant neighborhoods.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative modes of transportation, and create healthier and more sustainable communities. It is essential for us to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards a future with reduced reliance on cars.Votes for the president of the United States are counted each election in two ways, the popular vote and the Electoral College. The popular vote is the people\\'s vote, which allows our democratic nation to vote for their leader themselves, and the Electoral College is dependent upon the popular vote, and casts electoral votes based on the number of Representatives and Senators each state has in Congress Source One. People have consistently debated over whether or not this was a fair election process, due to the fact that the people\\'s votes do not directly go to the president. Because of this, many people want the Electoral College to be gone, and people have attempted to abolish it in the past. The Electoral College should be abolished and the US should adopt the popular vote system as their only system because we live in a democratic nation, the current electoral voting process may not represent the popular vote, and it\\'s a more fair system.\\n\\nAs citizens of the United States of America, we depend on the fact that we live in a free nation that values our justice, liberty, and voice. Included within our voice, we also depend on our democracy, that allows us to have say in who runs our country and how. It\\'s important that we take advantage of this voice we have in the government, and it\\'s also important we are represented fairly within it. When we depend on electors from the Electoral College to vote for who our states popular votes went to, they may not be doing that. They ultimately can decide who they are voting for, and if they decide to vote for the opponent, no one can stop them. It\\'s very easy for them to betray our trust without our awareness Source Two. Source Three also states that \"that trust is rarely betrayed,\" which makes it clear that although uncommon, there have been incidents in the past where the citizens have been represented unfairly. In a democratic nation, we should have true sovereignty and be able to cast our popular vote, and know that it is being counted and included in the final say of our leader.\\n\\nOverall, the Electoral Vote may not represent the Popular vote. As mentioned, there have been incidents in the past that have indicated the truthfulness of this statement. For example, in 1960 John F. Kennedy was almost opposed by unfair elections due to our country\\'s people being misrepresented Source Two. Even if the popular vote of our state goes one way, the \"faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\" Source Two. The electors are unreliable and may go one way just because they please to do so while leaving the faithful citizens in the dust with their decisions and votes meaning nothing. The popular vote system would better represent the people than the unreliable Electoral College system we have now.\\n\\nThe popular vote system is a more fair system, one of many reasons being that it would eliminate the advantage large and \"swing\" states have over others. Currently, \"swing\" states are being given more attention to be the candidates because the candidates realize that the fate of their presidency may be dependent upon these states Sources Two and Three. Since the Swing states are the ones who\\'s votes can go either way, the candidates spend more time with these states in order to insure their likelihood to achieve the states electoral votes. This is not a fair process because the other states are not getting to know the candidates like these states do. The same thing goes for large states. Since the number of electoral votes you have is dependent upon population, the larger states have more electorsrepresentatives. Therefore, the presidential candidates want to achieve as many electoral votes as possible and will make sure to appeal to the larger states, leaving the smaller states at a disadvantage due to misrepresentation. The popular vote system would take everyone into account evenly, and therefore represent everyone fairly, and make for a better voting system.\\n\\nAll in all, the current Electoral College system is unfair, misrepresented, and unappealing to a democratic nation. The system should be abolished for all of these reasons, and allow the popular voting system to come in to play. The popular vote system would allow each citizen to be represented equally, and create a more level and fair environment. It\\'s important that a democratic nation feels like one, and that we are all represented fairly, and there\\'s no better way to do so than by being our own representatives.As time progresses, more and more young people aren\\'t buying personal cars but instead use public transport or walk to where they need to go. Other than the youth, suburbs have found this as a great way to distress as some cities, like Bogota, Columbia, have dedicated a day to stop the use of personal cars for one day. This decline of using our own cars has a positive effect on our air and the way our youth has begun to travel.\\n\\nPeople around the world are starting to make this transition from using their personal cars to using public transport or carpooling with friends. The youth today try to mange their schedules so they can find ways to use more and more of public transit. \"There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 and 39 yearolds getting a license...\" Rosenthal 38, meaning that most of the youth these days are finding it easier and, though a little more time consuming, less worrisome than buying or driving a personal car. It seems getting a license isn\\'t taking top priority for the youth. \"In a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...\" Rosenthal 41.Whether the youth is going to start buying cars when they have children or not, it seems the general decline of buying automobiles for yourself isn\\'t a boom like it used to be.\\n\\nExperiments being hosted all over the world in small areas also show that using no cars is decreasing pollution and allowing us cleaner air overall. In Bogota, Columbia, a program that bans all cars for one day, and despite terrible weather for the third year, and it seems that people are loving it. And despite the threatening rain, the turn out was huge Selsky 22. \"...experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe...\"Rosenthal 5. Our personal cars \"are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States where areas are heavily populated with car owners\"Rosenthal 5. Numbers like this would decline over time if we start using less and less cars. Maybe then we\\'d actually have fresh air to breath rather than the polluted air we breath now. Even in Paris, where they have \"enough smog to compete with Beijing\"Duffer 14 they banned cars for a while. \"After days of nearrecord pollution, Paries enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\"Duffer 10. As they enforced the ban, smog started to clear up around the city, meaning that no cars can really help clear up the air we breath in daily.\\n\\nAs the air begins to clear up and our youth taking a stand against owning their own cars, it seems like this could be a steady decline of personal cars and more will start using public transport. It seems time is progressing to an age where young people don\\'t feel the haste of using personal cars and instead resort to public transport.Transportation by a vehicle like a car is very common these days. It\\'s an efficient way to travel for the most part, and has been used as an option for traveling since the early 1900s. Although cars have many upsides, they also have downsides too. By limiting car usage in more places, there could be many advantages. First, it could improve safety. Also, it will conserve resources. And lastly, limiting car usage will allow a tremendous decrease in pollution.\\n\\nLimiting car usage will improve safety in a number of ways. By limiting car usage, there will most likely be a decrease in deaths since many car accidents result in fatality. It is not only cars colliding with other cars that is the issue it is cars having the power to destroy most things it comes in contact with. Cars are not toys but rather death machines. They have the ability to cause major damage which is why if limited usage is enforced, there will most likely be less accidents resulting in majorminor injuries or even death. There are many options for getting around besides using a car. For example, there are electric scooters, mopeds, skateboards, rollerskates, bicycles, and even good oldfashioned walking. While some of these could potentially be dangerous, they are probably not as dangerous as driving a car.\\n\\nAnother reason limiting car usage could be beneficial is the conservation of resources. Cars are heavy machinery and need an abundance of fuel to keep them going for years and years. What powers most vehicles currently is fossil fuel. Fossil fuel is not an everlasting resource and will be gone someday. Now there are some cars that run on electricity, but for the most part, cars around the world run on fossil fuel. Considering that there are about one to two cars per household nowadays, that would mean both cars are probably getting filled with gas or even being charged with electricity which could run your electricity bill through the roof. Since this applies to most people around the world, think of the resources being used daily. This usage of resources could be lessened by just limiting the usage of cars.\\n\\nThe last benefit of limiting car usage is less air pollution. Cars run on fossil fuel, as I stated in the previous paragraph. When a car is being driven, that fuel exits the car in a gas state. This gas form of fuel is very harmful to the environment. With so many cars on the road today, the atmosphere is already polluted a great deal.\\n\\nUsually you will see signs that read \"No Idling\" outside of a store or any public area where cars are allowed which means that when you are parked, and are going to be parked for an extended period of time, you should turn your car off so that it does not let out gas. In Paris, a partial driving ban was actually enforced so that the amount of smog in the air would decrease. That is how much the usage of cars can affect an environment.\\n\\nOverall, setting a limitation on car usage in more places can have benefits. It could improve safety, conserve resources, and allow for less pollution to the environment. With these reasons, I don\\'t see many reasons for people to frown upon this idea.The electoral college, despite being established by the constitution, is a corruptible system that should be abolished. The ultimate duty of the government is to protect and serve the people of America, yet our votes must go through this extra step to pick what will ultimately affect us most.\\n\\nWhen we vote, we choose who will be running our affairs for the next four years. America needs a president who can govern us in this world of problems, so why would the system overlook portions of the public? What keeps the Members of the college in line with public interests? there is too much instability in the college for it to always align with the best interest of the American people because in its \"winner takes all\" policy it overlooks all members of that state who voted otherwise. The college looks at us like divided pieces, when we really are a whole puzzle. For example, when the majority of floridian vote for one candidate, while just over half of the population of Texas votes for the other, looking at these two states only texas would win, despite more people in total voting for the other candidate. This may not seem like a common occurrence, as article three stated it has happened only twice since 1888, but there is nothing to keep such actions from progressing.\\n\\nWhat service does the Electoral college serve that the people cannot? its only purpose in the government is to elect the president. The public, however, is the life and soul of America. The government exists solely to keep order among us. There is no reason why a popular vote wouldn\\'t show the best interest of the people, and a popular vote doesn\\'t overlook any vote.\\n\\nThe greatest problems lie with the tiebreakers, because inthe event of a tie, the election\\'s result goes to the legislature. a few people in congress are looking to fuel their own desires. when presented with the chance to earn more money, they would rather choose the option that will earn them more, even if it means going against the interest of the public.\\n\\nThe electoral college isn\\'t a complete public enemy, however. The electoral votes are decided based upon a popular vote, so they reflect the public\\'s interest, if a little distorted. Maine and Nebraska have an alternate setup of \"proportional representation\" as explained in article one. If anything is to be done, a simple reform would suffice. if electoral votes were awarded per a set number of people, it would better reflect the population than if votes were awarded entirely based upon the will of a state as a whole.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nAs our cities become increasingly crowded and our planet faces the threat of climate change, it is becoming clear that we need to find alternatives to our car-dependent lifestyles. Limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation can have several advantages for individuals and society as a whole. This essay will discuss the benefits of limiting car usage based on information from the passages provided.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some areas of the United States. By reducing car usage, we can make a significant impact in reducing our carbon footprint and combating climate change.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. The passages mention several instances where cities had to implement driving bans or car-free days due to smog and high levels of pollution. These measures resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and an improvement in air quality. For example, in Paris, congestion decreased by 60% after a partial driving ban was enforced. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can create cleaner and healthier cities.\\n\\nLimiting car usage also has benefits for individuals. The passages mention that residents of car-free communities reported being happier and less stressed compared to when they owned cars. This is supported by the experience of residents in Vauban, Germany, where 70% of families do not own cars. One resident stated, “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way.” By relying less on cars, individuals can enjoy the benefits of less traffic, more walkable neighborhoods, and a more active and healthy lifestyle.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible neighborhoods. The passages mention the concept of \"smart planning\" in which suburbs are designed to be less dependent on cars and more accessible to public transportation. This includes placing stores within walking distance and creating compact communities. This approach not only reduces the need for cars but also promotes a sense of community and interaction among residents.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages for individuals and society. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, and creates healthier and more connected communities. It also leads to less traffic congestion and can contribute to individuals\\' happiness and well-being. It is time to rethink our car-dependent lifestyles and embrace alternative modes of transportation for a sustainable and livable future.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to argue against changing to a presidential election by popular vote. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits and is a crucial part of our democratic system.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote, resulting in a clear victory. This principle is extremely important in minimizing potential disputes over the outcome of an election, as was seen in the 2000 election, when the popular vote winner did not win the presidency. With the Electoral College, the winning candidate\\'s share of the electoral votes almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of post-election controversies.\\n\\nAnother reason to maintain the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president is everyone\\'s president. With no region having enough electoral votes to single-handedly elect a president, candidates are required to have trans-regional appeal. This means that they must reach out to a broad range of voters across different regions, rather than focusing solely on regions where they have the highest support. By promoting candidates with nationwide appeal, the Electoral College helps to ensure that the interests of diverse regions and populations are represented in the presidency.\\n\\nThe swing state system, facilitated by the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes, is another important aspect of the Electoral College that should be preserved. In states with a close race, candidates are compelled to focus their campaign efforts and resources on these swing states, where a small margin of votes can tip the electoral balance. This incentivizes candidates to listen to and address the concerns of swing state voters, leading to a more informed and engaged electorate. Moreover, swing state voters are often more thoughtful voters, as they receive the most attention and information from the candidates during the campaign.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College restores balance between big and small states. While large states lose representation in the Senate due to mal-apportionment, the Electoral College grants them more attention from presidential candidates. A close popular vote in a large state can result in a significant number of electoral votes, compared to a small state with a similar margin of victory. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on campaigning in highly populated regions, but also engage with voters from various states, regardless of their population size.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. With the current system, a clear winner is almost always determined, as opposed to situations where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. Run-off elections can be time-consuming and complicated, potentially undermining the efficiency and effectiveness of the presidential election process.\\n\\nWhile some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, the voter turnout in our country continues to be substantial. About half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite their individual votes having limited impact on the national outcome. Citizens vote to express their political preferences and contribute to the democratic process, rather than with the expectation that their vote will single-handedly decide an election.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College has served our nation well by providing certainty of outcome, ensuring that the president is everyone\\'s president, promoting engagement in swing states, balancing representation between big and small states, and avoiding run-off elections. Replacing it with a popular vote system would undermine these important benefits. I strongly urge you to consider the significance of these arguments and support the continuation of the Electoral College.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration of my perspective. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and our nation.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]The Electoral College is a process which occurs in the United States to help determine the president for the next four years of the entire nation. It is a very controversial topic and a plethora of people want to disregard the Electoral College. People want to vote for their president, but ultimately they are voting for the electors of the state who represent the president in the end. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It makes the voters feel like they have less power when they are voting and when people of a nation feel that way, they lose interest and lose the desire to vote for their country because they feel like their vote will not count or have and affect.\\n\\nAt the end of paragraph 10, two questions are asked, \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for?\" and \"Do voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?\". The answers werenot always and sometimes. If a system or process confuses people enough where they vote for the wrong candidate they desired, then that system needs to go. That system is the Electoral College.\\n\\nThe single best argument against the electoral college is the disaster factor. With a name like that, you know this system cannot be good. Also, 3 high ranking officials and a couple of them that opposed the electoral college, were former presidents. They were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. The electoral confused system works like this. Voters vote for a slate of electors who in turn are the ones who elect the president. Is\\'nt the whole point of the election to vote for your candidate that you would like to win, and not his employees\\'? When a state votes for a president and has their majority vote, then the amount of electors in the state are what counts towards the voting polls. The state electors could be anyone not holding office at that time. Furthermore, electoral votes can possible end in a tie due to the fact that there is an even number of electors, 568, which is a big worry in the result of the election. Compared to electoral votes, there is only 55 representatives in California, but there is 35 million people in the state. A tie almost guaranteed, will not happen with that comparison.\\n\\nA winner take all system is in play with the electoral college process. The system consists of when a president wins an election then all electors part or even somewhat representing that candidate are now with the president. Also bigger states have more representatives and the candidates focus more on those states to try and win them over. it leaves the smaller states like Wyoming and South Dakota, for example, to be left out of the equation and not be focused on too much in the process.\\n\\nAll in all, the elctorall college and process needs to be abolished and is not fair to the people of the nation voting and being taken advantage of.Cars are a huge advantage in traveling. They can get people to places faster than a single horse could and their a lot safer than riding on a horse. While there are positive advantages to these moble transportation, there are also negative portions that cars have. You may be awfully surprised what these transports can do outside their good nature. For instance, cars run on fossil fuel, which is a artificial gas that ruins the environment as much as people cutting down trees and smoke coming out of nuclear plants that do damage to the clouds in the sky. Cars don\\'t just hurt the environment, they hurt innocent lives as well. Let me pull out an example: Person A and Person C are driving on the interstate when Person B spills out too much fossil fuel from the exhaust pipe of his car. This causes both Person A & C to spin out of control and crash into each other because they couldn\\'t see the road very well because of Person B. This isn\\'t the only threat cars can pull into, but I\\'ll get to that later. With all these bad occurrences that happen people have been wondering, \"how can we save both lives and the environment from the issues of cars at the same time\"? There is a way to do just that: limiting car usage.\\n\\nLike I said before, cars can have a lot of negative issues in their state of mind. Some examples are foggy weather, over usage of fossil fuel, speeding, texting and driving, drunk driving and many more that exist that I cannot mention. Because of these issues, cities like Vauban Germany, Paris France and Bogota Colombia have bannedwell not really banned but you get what i mean driving cars due to the bad issues cars canhave caused. In the US, the presentage of people driving cars has decreased a lot over the past few years the story doesn\\'t say what persentage. As much as I hate them doing that, they actually have a reason. In this case of fellow citizens, car usage should be banned for various reasons. I won\\'t be telling all the reasons because that would take a long time to do so.\\n\\nReason 1: Drunk driving. Have you ever known someone or heard about an incident were a person is drunk inside a car and crashes into any random source they don\\'t see coming? Well, let us face the facts: drunk people should not drive. If someone is drunk at a bar and is feeling funny, they should either walk home or get someone to pick them up. Drunk people who drive have a great chance at getting someone hurt of themselves hurt because of their stupid attitude. The person shouldn\\'t drive again until they are fully consious again. Reason 2: Extreme weather. When people drive in extreme, they are risking their lives in a greater persentage than a zombie apocolypse, terrorists invading any country and being attacked by people who try to kill you. Extreme weather like thunderstorms, hail and strong fog are too dangerous for people to drive in. If you drive in that type of weather, there is a 90% chance you will not make it out without injuries. People need to wait for the weather to either calm down or stop completelyI just wait until it stops completely so that it wouldn\\'t get worse as it calms down. This will help them prevent them or anyone from getting a wreck. If it occurs randomly while your driving then your screwed. Reason 3: texting and driving. Why is it that most people in this generation keep getting stupid and stupid every single minute? This is one of those incidents that has such that. People who text while driving pay more attention to their stupid phone than focusing on driving. Like drunk driving people who care about texting so much need to either sit in the back and text or not ride in the car at all. They propably should stay away from a car as long as possible until they learn to not text and drive at the same time. You can\\'t do two things at once unless you\\'re some one fictional or a pro at it. Final reason: Expoit of fossil fuels. I don\\'t need to talk much about this one because I already did in my first paragraph and it is related to the extreme weather topic but I will do it once more. Cars that exploit fossil fuels can cause damage to the environment. If the smoke is exploited too much it can not only more damage to the environment, but it can cause people to reck as well.\\n\\nThese are the reasons that fellow citizens like you should limit your car usages. Remember that cars are not a same transportation vehicle that can get you from point A to Point B, they have a dark side like everything else. Even if you do limit your car usages, it doesn\\'t mean you are safe from the world that hunts you down. Be careful out there and follow the percautions of safty carefully when you are traveling either by car or anyother place.In a society where things are always changing and schedules are always busy, cars and other personal motor vehicles have become a necessity. It seems as if cars have become a necessary mean for survival, rendering as important as something imperative like oxygen or water. Many families even have multiple cars in order to get to where the need to go. Even though cars have been so convenient and beneficial for people all over the world, there are some factors of cars that produce a negative effect. By eliminating or largly reducing car usage, the world would be more safe, more ecofriendly, and save the precious natural gases that the Earth provides.\\n\\nFor years people have been driving, and while most do it safely, some do it recklessly and do not abide by the rules, sometimes leading to fatal outcomes. Reckless driving, careless driving, and driving under the influence has become one of the leading causes of death among young people, making many very skeptical or cautious about driving. Millions of people are lost each year in car accidents, leaving behind family members and loved ones to grieve in their place. If cars were to be eliminated from the equation, all of these deaths could easily be avoided. By walking, riding bicycles, taking the bus or subway, or even a trolley or ferry, there will be an ensured reduction of accidents and an increase in safety and peace of mind.\\n\\nIn addition to increased safety, there would also be a significant reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases and smog have been polluting the atmosphere especially since the coming about of cars. It says in source four that transportation produces half of America\\'s carbon emission. If car usage were to be limited or eliminated, there would be a noticeable and significant decrease in the amount of carbon emissions in the air. Similarly, source one states that, \" passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.\" If cars were to be ridden of, there would be much less green house gas poluting the atmosphere, therefore creating a cleaner environment and a brighter and longer future for the generations to come.\\n\\nSimilarly, the removal of cars from the world would mean the preservation of nonrenewable resources. Since cars run on gasoline, diesel, and other natural gases, the resources are being burned up faster than they can replenish themselves. There are other things that rely on the natural gases to work, cars included. If cars were to be eliminated, and not use the gases at the rapid rate that they do, there would be a huge reduction in the usage for fossil fuels, therefore preserving the remaining resources and only using them when mandatory. This would allow the natural gases to slowly increase and be able for use in the future.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the limitations of car usage would make a significant change in the way the world runs, however there would be many positive outcomes to it. Not only would it ensure a brighter, longer, and more promising future for the coming generations, but it would also relieve stress and worrying and grant peace of mind to many. Although there is no way to take back the damage already done to the Earth, this would greatly reduce the potential damage that could be done, and protect the future. It would provide oppurtunities for a a cleaner atmosphere, safer life, living in harmony with the ecosystem, and a chance to respect and protect the Earth we live on.The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage in cities and suburbs can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. The articles \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" by Robert Duffer, \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky, and \"The End of Car Culture\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal provide evidence and examples of the benefits of reducing car dependence.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the articles, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, particularly in suburban areas, emissions can be greatly reduced. For example, in the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited, 70% of families do not own cars. This has resulted in a significant decrease in emissions and a more environmentally-friendly community.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality. In the city of Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced in response to high levels of smog. The ban led to a 60% decrease in congestion and a significant improvement in air quality. Similar initiatives have been implemented in other cities, such as Bogota, Colombia, where a car-free day was introduced to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. These examples demonstrate that by reducing car usage, cities can experience better air quality and a healthier environment.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. In the German suburb of Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This promotes a pedestrian-friendly environment and encourages people to walk or use public transportation instead of relying on cars. In addition, limiting car usage can reduce traffic congestion and the need for extensive parking spaces, allowing for more efficient land use and the development of other amenities, such as parks and sports centers. \\n\\nThere are also economic benefits to limiting car usage. In Paris, delivery companies complained of lost revenue due to the driving ban, but exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This shows that by promoting alternative transportation options, such as electric vehicles and carpooling, cities can support innovative industries and reduce reliance on traditional car usage.\\n\\nOverall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, more compact and accessible communities, and economic benefits. As cities and suburbs around the world implement initiatives to reduce car dependence, it becomes clear that these measures not only benefit individuals and the environment, but also lead to more sustainable and livable communities.To begin , i think that the electoral college is not working. Because under the electoral college system voters dont vote for the president they vote for a slate of electors. And from source two it says that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational , and that many people think that the electoral college should be abolished.\\n\\nAdditionally, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because the winner takes all the systems in each state because candidates dont spend time in the state they know they not going to have a chance to win. And also they dont get to have their ads every where in every state because in Rhode Island and South Carolina voters in 25 of the biggest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad.\\n\\nPlus ,I think that the electoral college docent work because voters can not control whom their electors vote for. And sometimes voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate because this system is so confusing and bad that its to the point that the electoral college needs to be abolished. Also i think that the that electoral college does not work because it is very outdated and things have changed in this world and that we need a new system so our citizens can choose on how they want the worlds or government system to be like as years pasts bye. Plus many have said and argued that the Electoral College method of selecting a president may turn off potential voters for a candidate.\\n\\nWhy should the Electoral college be abolished ? Because we as people should have a choice to select a president without having someone to select for us after we selected the president we want to control our country. And we shouldnt have to worry about if i electors choose the right president for us because it states that \"Some electors use your votes for them so that either choose who they want to become president or use your votes to support them if they want to run for president\". And to be honest i really dont think this system is organized correct because for this system to be good they would need for all elections to be equal and for electors not to use our votes and pick who they want like some do because they have no proof that electors are choosing the people that we want to be come president and to protect the United states.\\n\\nTo conclude , i think that the electoral college is not working. Because of lack of equal rights and votes towards who should be the president of the United States Of America.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, Zip]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Address]\\n[City, State, Zip]\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. After carefully analyzing the information presented in various texts, I am convinced that the Electoral College should be retained for several reasons, despite some valid concerns that have been raised.\\n\\nOne of the key arguments in favor of keeping the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner\\'s article, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. This means that the Electoral College system reduces the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome of an election, as the winner\\'s mandate is clear. In contrast, a popular vote system could potentially result in closer margins and more disputes over the legitimacy of the election, as exemplified by the 2000 presidential election.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal, as explained by Judge Posner. This system requires a candidate to have support from multiple regions throughout the country to secure victory. This avoids a situation where a candidate only appeals to one particular region, which would result in other regions feeling disenfranchised and marginalized. The Electoral College promotes a more inclusive presidency that considers the interests of a diverse range of regions.\\n\\nAnother important advantage of the Electoral College is its focus on swing states. According to Judge Posner, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to campaign in states where the election outcome is uncertain. This leads to more focused and targeted campaigns that take into account the concerns and issues of voters in these crucial states. Swing states have a significant impact in deciding the election, and this system encourages candidates to engage with voters in those states, thereby giving them a voice in the election process.\\n\\nIn addition, the Electoral College balances the representation of big states and small states. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College restores some weight to large states in the political balance, considering the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns of voters in both large and small states, instead of solely focusing on the interests of highly populated areas. The Electoral College system promotes a more equitable distribution of political attention and resources.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College helps avoid run-off elections. As noted by Judge Posner, the Electoral College allows for a clear winner to emerge, even if a candidate does not secure a majority of the popular vote. This reduces the need for additional rounds of elections and the associated complications that come with it. The Electoral College ensures that the election process remains streamlined and efficient.\\n\\nWhile there are valid criticisms of the Electoral College system, such as the winner-take-all system and the potential for faithless electors, the advantages outlined above make a compelling case for retaining this system. It provides certainty, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, balanced representation of states, and avoids run-off elections.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I urge you to consider the benefits that the Electoral College brings to the presidential election process. It provides stability, representation, and fairness to voters across different regions of our nation. I believe that the Electoral College should be preserved, as it has proven to be an effective compromise between direct popular vote and election by Congress. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Every four years since the founding of the United States, a president has been elected by the people to lead the U.S. According to source 1, the system used to select the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral College involves voters voting for president they want, as normal, and then the president that got the majority vote in that state gets all of that state\\'s electoral votes. Supporters of the Electoral College claim that it is good that the presidents focus more on swing states, and that they are more likely to be the thoughtful voters, but there is zero evidence shown to support this, and it makes presidents focus on states disproportionately. The Electoral College should be abolished and replaced by the popular vote system, as it is an outdated method compared to modern technology, makes the vote of an individual seem even more insignificant, and makes presidents not campaign in states that are small or loyal to them.\\n\\nSince the Electoral College was hundreds of years ago, it does not account for all of the new technologies that have been developed since then. The founding fathers could not have possibly thought that it would be possible to easily count all of the nation\\'s votes with a machine, but now it is possible. It is likely that the reason they thought of the Electoral College in the first place was because it would mean that they could spread out the tallying of votes between the states, instead of doing it all at once. Nowadays though, there are computers that can count votes faster than ever imagined. Popular vote is now a viable method since every person\\'s vote can be accurately counted.\\n\\nDue to the Electoral College relying on a majority rules system, the vote of a single person can be completely insignificant. According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, \"Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election....\" This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody\\'s vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn\\'t vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on who to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, \"... those electors could always defy the will of the people,\" and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an antithesis to democracy, because a citizen\\'s vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points.\\n\\nBoth those who support the Electoral College system and those who oppose it agree that the Electoral College puts a much bigger focus on swing states and states with large populations, according to sources 2 and 3. To put this into perspective, here\\'s an example of why supporting big swing states should not be rewarded. The US has 6 states. 5 are completely democrats and each have populations of 20. 1 is half democrat half republican and has a population of 100assume 20 people equals an electoral vote. If the republican presidential candidate convinces a single democrat in the big state to vote for them, they will get the majority vote in that state and get 5 electoral votes. This results in the democratic presidential candidate, with 149 people supporting him, tying with the republican presidential candidate, with 51 people supporting him. Simple logic shows that the opinion of 149 people is more important than that of 51 people, so a popular vote system would have been best in this situation. The focus on certain states is such a popular method by the presidential candidates, that, according to source 2, \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all...\"Big states and swing states should not receive much more attention per citizen from the presidential candidates than little states do.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It\\'s like the government is rounding the votes. The winnertakesall method of the Electoral College can render a voter\\'s vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter\\'s wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person\\'s opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems \"easier,\" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.The Electoral College is a easy, yet hard way of a candidate becomingthe President of the United States. The Electoral college was created by how ever many majority of the electoral votes will become the new president. This brings many issues within the U.S.. The popularity vote does not matter in a situation like this and is not likely relied on to decide who the president will be. The Electoral College is not right, it\\'sunfair, and is very controversial. The argument though is that withthe Electoral College the votes which are dominant have a better chance of the two nominees not having the same amount of votes rather than if it was relied on by the popularity votes. This still though does not resolve nor question that the Electoral College needs to be replaced.\\n\\nInitially, the Electoral College is not right at all. The electoral votes in the U.S. combined throughout all the states equals 538votes. Popularity votes which are votes that have an advantage of the election are more than tens of thousands if not more. This is an example on how the Electoral College works. An example of this is in the source by \"Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" it states, \" Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 42 percent of the popularity vote but won through the electoral votes because they had bigger states voting for them making them win that election\". This shows how the Electoral College is not right and should reverse the value of electoral and popularity votingPoshner, 22.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College votingis very unfair because many sources giving have shown to people that many candidateshave had less popularity vote but have won through the majority of the electoral votes. This is unfair because popularity votes mean popularity votes which are votes that are of the majority of all votes. Unfortunately, the popularity votes do not count. As said in the source \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" it states, \" if you wanted to vote for John Kerry and you lived in Texas the vote would go to 34 Democratic electors that pledged to Kerry\". This is why popularity vote should be the deciding factor of who becomes the next President. If every election would be based on popularity vote the candidate won each of those elections would probably all change due to the fact that so many elections have won based on electoral votePlumer,10.\\n\\nTo end with, the Electoral College is so controversial. Out of more than two hundredyears of elections many have been close and many have been a mile away from each other. The electoral vote decides it all though. The main problem with this process is how it is setup. The electoral vote is dominent over the popular vote, but it shouldnt be. The electoral vote has made bad decisions yet good decisions throughout the hundreds of years its been around and the main reasin for electoral votes are to keep the candidates running not havethe same number of votes so that they won\\'t have to have another election and voting cast. \"It is also really controversial since the voting also might rely on the political party that the candidate is running for\", as stated by \"What is the Electoral College\". This Electoral College seems to go by how big the state is, the bigger the state themore electoralvotes that state has the smaller the state the less electoral votes that that state hasFederal Register, 5.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College is unaccurate, lazy, unreasonable, yet successful. This process by many sources of evidence have concluded that there are in fact many holesin this system. Yet some sources have provedhow the Electoral College has helped decide the outcomes and have stopped runoff elections. The Electoral College is unfair, not right and controversial and has also proved that it has pros to all these cons as well.The advantages of limiting car usage can be a great way to be protected from the dangers that are found within the driving experience, and support the amount and less usage of greenhouse gas that can destroy our atmosphere.\\n\\nThe advantage that can be found with limiting car usage can help to be protected from the dangers found within driving. Source 1 explains how Heidrun Walter feels \"When i had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way.\" Walking and other ways of getting around, other than cars can help people go to places and have that advantage, as source 3 implies \"leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.\" our technology has been growing at a quick pace and as source 4 mentions \" Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.\" All of these new ideas has led to the conclusion that cars are not needed since all these second choices are present.\\n\\nThe Advantage of limiting car usage can help and support the amount and less usage of greenhouse gas that can destroy or atmosphere. Source 1 concludes \" Experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe.\" Cars are the main reason why our earth can be in danger from all these gases. People need to follow what businessman Carlos Arturo said \"it\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" Some countries such as Paris has all ready taken this advantage, source 2 mentions, \"After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" If people have tryied this change in their lives, others such as one self can too.\\n\\nThe advantages of limiting car usage can be a great way to be protected from the dangers of driving, and support the amount and less usage of greenhouse gas that can destroy our atmosphere. Taking a break off of the car can help our lives be much more safe than sorry. Our lives could be much more easier and not only will we be safe but our planet earth as well.I think that we should change to popular vote for president of the United States. Instead of the electorsal College. I think this for a lot of reasons, one is because you dont vote for the president but for the electorss. It is unfair because they have a winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to decide. electorss can defy the will of the people. The electorsal college should be changed to popular vote for the president.\\n\\nFirst, you have to vote for the electorss not the president. Then only if they win there votes go through. You can\\'t even control who the electorss vote for. Voters sometimes get confused on who there voting for and vote for the wrong electors. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than what we have now.\\n\\nThen, they have the winner takes all system. Also candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. Seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all. states like Rhode Island, South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn\\'t even see a campaign ad. Though they established electorsal college in the constitution Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all, agreed on abolishing the electorsal college.\\n\\nLastly, electers can defy the will of the people. The state legislatures are resposible for picking the electorss. If there is a tie between the electorss then the state gets to decide. Richard Nixon was presiding over the senate he then validated only his opponent\\'s electorss. He made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. What if this possibly happens again?\\n\\nThe electorsal college should be changed to popular vote for the president. This should be done because the electorsal college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. You also dont vote for the president you vote for the electorss. Its also unfair because of the winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to vote for the president. The electorsal college should be changed to the popular vote for the president, because the electorss can defy the will of the people.Everyone nowadays is so used to driving a car here and there even if it would just be five minutes on foot, but what if you started limiting your car usage? Making your feet be your gas instead of a pump when the distance is close enough, and even biking occasionally. Limiting car usage may sound like a bad thing, but it has many advantages such as reducing pollution, increasing safety for human beings, and even opening options for alternative transportion.\\n\\nCars release a great amount of pollutants into the air increasing smog in some areas worse than others, like in Paris, China, and other places. Providing or opening your mind to other ways to get from one destination to the next, would reduce the smog thats in the air. This simple action as close to 70% of the population pitching in can result in a healthier environment, and some people may agree with hepburn Walter. She says \"When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way.\" Not only that, people who do not agree or get rid of their transportion vehicles will be fined. For example, in Germany you have to pay 40,000 if you want to get a car owner space and this does not include the money you have to spend on your house. Than, in Paris 4,000 drivers were fined 31 dollars after not leaving their cars home after a public announcement was made to do so. This shows that opening this can increase health, or make an environment cleaner. Plus, you actually inforcing something that is good for the environment will get people to participate, such as a fine.\\n\\nHearing engines roar and cars zoom pace is a sound all too familiar with citizens who walk or ride constantly. It can be quite on the thrilling side crossing the streets or even walking down a busy rode when you know being hit is a possibly. Limiting car usage can decrease the risks or heavy weighted vehicles hitting biking, or walking citizens that dont have a chance against the weight. This increases safety, bumping into another human or being nudged by a bike wont affect your body as much as a 500 pound or even heavier car crashing into a 100 pound person. Like, Carlos Arturo said \"It\\'s a good opportuinity to take away stress...\" meaning the stess that comes with a car. The money for gas and the risk or hitting someone or being hit is taken away when on foot or on bike. This shows limting car usage isnt only increasing the safety or people walking or biking, it also takes away stess factors like money, fixing a car if it needs repair, and other factors.\\n\\nFinally, having alternate forms of transportion can open your eyes to a whole need world. Instead of constanly beiong locked in your 4 door honda prison or your house you\\'re outside seeing new people and increasing social interaction. Not only this, but you\\'re getting excerise and maintaining your health or builing it. Which is another reason to limit the amount we use our cars. This shows that doing so can not only increase saftery, and money, but health and social oppurtunitys.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages even if you dont realize it and our soiciety could benefit a lot from it. Like, when it comes to the safety of the next generation, the present, or the previous. Than, it can even take away stress that come with a vechicle and even increase health and social gathering.There are many advantages to limiting car usage and many people are starting to see it. In the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" By Elisabeth Rosenthal She goes to explain that in Vauban, Germany there is a community that have given up on cars. Without a car on the streets you can tell its more lively with the quote \"Heidrun walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked berdants streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.\" With that quote from the article you can tell that the streets are filled with the sound of people rather than the sound of motors and smoke from the vehicles.\\n\\ncertainly not having cars is a great advantage to suburbs, in Rosenthal article it said \" there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking... in attempt to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation... in this new approach, stores are placed a walk away...\" Instead of wasting gas and filling the air with disgusting gas, stores could be just around the corner. Which in return would be easier for everyone around. Even the united states, environmental protection agency is promoting\"car reduced\" communities.\\n\\nAnother advantage to limiting car usage is to reduce smog and air pollution, in the article \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" by Robery duffer he informs us that paris actually enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It stated \" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog... the smog rivaled Bejing,china, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\" By banning driving they not only were able to reduce the smog and air pollution, They obviously reduced car traffic!\\n\\nAlso In the article \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota\" by Andrew Selsky, they banned car in an effort to promote alternative transportation and reduce spog. In the article is said \"parks and sports center also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad , smooth sidewalks rushhouse restrictins have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants andupscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" The day also is said to help lower stress, \" It\\'s a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air population,\"said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife.\\n\\nAs you can tell from the facts within this essay, there are definitly many advantages with limiting car usage, from reducing smog and pollution, to having stores built closer to home. These advantages not only help the citzens but also the planet we live on, and our future children and their children and so on...There are so many advantages of limiting car usage. In source one, the vaughn\\'s streets are completely \"carfree\". This is for the good of not cluttering the streets with so many cars but actually making more space and less cars on the streets. In source one, it says \"while there hace been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs.\" That right there says they have been trying to reduce car usage for a while now and convince citizens that transportation can be better to use. Instead of having over a million cars on the streets or high ways or anywhere, many people can come together and take transportation train or bus to where ever they need to go. It also makes time for walking, which is a very good exercise. Many people have become lazy and take their car to drive to the store thats right there on the corner instead of walking. Many people have taken car usage over the limits and don\\'t realize how it is polluting our air.\\n\\nPollution is a big problem in our ecosystem now and days. Many people don\\'t clearly see this and don\\'t take the time to process in how bad its making earth. Pollution has gone up over the years and decades after decades we have tried to stop it. In source two, it says \"Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals.\" Why? Well because of the exaggerated use of cars. They have tried to reduce the usage in order to make their air cleaner and better. They have gotten the idea of limiting car usage by ordering people with evennumbered license plates to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine on Mondays. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day. With this new policy, it has shown better air in the city of Paris by Monday. I believe this is a great forced rule. We need to change our ways and work better in making our air cleaner.\\n\\nTraffic jams is another downfall of using cars. With so many cars out in the streets it causes the air to have so much smog. Many people have participated in bike riding and walking, but not only is it exercise for your health but it keeps away from people using their cars. With so many people participating this action, not only has it made better air burt also constructed and cropped up new restaurants and shopping districts. They cleared the side walk to make it smoother and cut traffic, as said in source three. This is all in Bogota, Columbia. They said it has made a drastic change in their community with better air and I believe it has made their air better and way reduced smog.\\n\\nIn the United States, President Obama\\'s goal was to curb the United States\\' greenhouse gas emissions. This has led to many people participating in this action. A very big amount of Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and fewer licences as each year goes by as said in source four. To keep this at a going rate each year I believe citizens should work harder to improve more in this situation as in car pooling, bicycle and public transportation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are so many advantages in reducing car usage. Better air, better community and healthier citizens.Starting with the end of World War II, cars have been a cultural hub all around the world, with businesses and even entire economies relying on the production and sale of cars and car products. However, after over sixty years of a car based global economy, the use of cars is beginning to slowly decline. With the decline of car usage, we see decreases in greenhouse gas pollution, a more relaxed living style, and the dawn of a new era of culture and economy around the globe.\\n\\nSeveral major cities around the world have attempted to lower caruse through laws or even annual days devoted to reduced caruse. In Vauban, Germany, seventy percent of the population does not own a car, and fifty three percent of that population sold a car to move to Vauban. Vauban has condensed its suburban layout so that everything is within practical walking range for the most part. They have also discouraged caruse by making parking only available in two places, \"Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home\" Rosenthal, paragraph 2. Vauban has reported drastic reductions in greenhouse gases. Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting \"carreduced\" communites in order to cut down greenhouse gas emissions, and legislators are acting on the issue. Experts claim that public transportation is beginning to play a larger role in suburbs, and a larger budget is now being given to public transportation instead of highways. Paris also has reduced driving to reduce smog, but they did it through laws. After suffering recordbreaking pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban on driving. On Monday, evennumbered license plates could not drive, or they would be fined twenty two euros, or about thirty one dollars. On Tuesday, the same thing applied to odds. From this driving ban, congestion was lowered up to sixty percent in the French capital. Throughout multiple global cities, these reductions of caruse have had a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions, and more cities are beginning to join in.\\n\\nAlong with the benifit of reduced greenhouse gases, carreduced societies also have a more relaxed living style. In Vauban Germany, citizens have claimed that they are enjoying a more relaxed life with much less stress. Heidrun Walter was quoted in Elisabeth Rosenthal\\'s article \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\" Rosenthal, paragraph 3. Andrew Selsky\\'s article on carfree days in Bogota, Colombia also states that people enjoy the relief of less stress when they don\\'t use their cars. \"\\'It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\\' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife\" Selsky, paragraph 24. If a drop in caruse leads to a happier, healthier life style, this will most likely set off a cyclicle action of caruse reduction to relief of stress and back to caruse reduction. As more people realize this potential benifit of reducing caruse, more people will beginning to join the population of reduced caruse.\\n\\nThe vast empire of cars that began with the end of World War II has reached its peak and is beginning a steady decline. For nearly seventy years, cars and car products have been a cultural and economical stimulant in both developed and developing countries. From the ModelT to the Buggatti, cars have been percieved as the thing to have over radios, television, and other mass media. Now that they are becoming less used, culture will slowly begin to shift to a different source to hype about. The production of new models of cars and new types of cars will slow and eventually halt all together. As well as culture evolving to a new phase, economy will also undergo major changes. Economy all around the world has been stimulated by auto industries, and international trade has been influenced heavily by it. For example, foreign cars are driven in America more often than domesticallymanufactured cars. Now that caruse is declining, the economy will suffer a major crash in stocks in the auto industry. Although this crash will harm the economy, the everchanging population of Earth will quickly find some new innovation to obssess over and the market will quickly recover and improve on this new product. With a new culture and economy, the world will be in a new era, a new age of living.\\n\\nWith the decline of car usage, we see decreases in greenhouse gas pollution, a more relaxed living style, and a possibilty of a new era of culture and economy around the globe. As the problems with cars are found, people have and will continue to resolve the problem by reducing caruse. The Earth will become healthier with a nicer atmosphere, the population will lead happier lives, and culture itself will transform with the end of major caruse.Forida senator, I argue to remove the Electoral College and replace it by changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Voting is not fair to the people because they can\\'t vote for the President, only for the state electors, and even if the candidate that won the most popular votes, may not be elected. Also, the winnertakesall system is not fair to voters because the candidates don\\'t spend time in states they cannot win in or small states and mostly in swing states.\\n\\n\"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" The passage stated in paragraph 10. Voting has changed over many years, but I think that people should be able to vote for the President and have that candidate win the election if they get the majority of popular votes. If the people want to have that candidate as the President, so be it. Although the Electoral College may help by not having a tied election and have a \"Certainty of Outcome\", but it should be what the people want and vote for. In my opinion, it would be better to not feel like you\\'re putting in a vote that isn\\'t what you wanted. The vote from the people go to state electors for them to choose and that is not truly fair to the people.\\n\\nThe candidates should spend time in all states to try to get their vote instead of the winnertakesall system therefore, it should be removed. There are people in the state that have voted for that candidate but they don\\'t go to the state because they only focus on the swing states. I understand that they do go there to try to win the election and become president, but they should at least spend some amount of time in other states. \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn\\'t get to see a single campaign ad.\" As stated in the passage in paragraph 13.\\n\\nSo overall, the electoral college should be replaced by having the popular vote be the decider of who gets to be president. It\\'s fair to the people and to the country.Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Learning from Global Models\\n\\nSignificant climatic changes have necessitated shifts in individual and societal behavior for the sake of our planet\\'s wellbeing. One such change, as illustrated in the readings, is the concession of car use in various regions around the world from Vauban, Germany, to Bogota, Colombia. Evidence from these global examples suggests many potential advantages of restraining car use – these include promoting healthy environments, enhancing communal interaction, and reshaping urban planning.\\n\\nVauban, Germany, demonstrates a laudable approach to car liming; 70 percent of its families do not own cars (\"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" passage 3). This lack of reliance on cars contributes to their peaceful and serene environment, and many inhabitants have suggested they are happier without cars (passage 3). Also, Vauban utilizes a smart planning approach that limits parking spaces and promotes the use of bicycles and trams, significantly reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of the town.\\n\\nSimilarly, the inhabitants of Bogota, Colombia, undertake a yearly \"Day Without Cars,\" which aims to promote alternative transportation systems (\"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" passage 21). The project has not only reduced air pollution, but also sparked a revolution in transportation policies, with other countries observing and intending to replicate their model (passage 26). \\n\\nMoreover, the rise of alternative transportation methods, such as public transportation and cycling, have reinvigorated the center cities that for many years had been overshadowed by the suburban lifestyle predominantly centered around private car ownership (“The End of Car Culture,” passage 31). The technological era has also played a role in limiting car usage. Telecommuting, facilitated by the internet, has considerably reduced the number of individuals commuting to and from work, thereby reducing the carbon emissions from transportation (passage 34 & 35).\\n\\nIncreasingly, cities globally are experiencing severe adverse environmental effects due to the high usage of private vehicles. The example of Paris implementing a partial driving ban due to near-record pollution indicates the critical need to shift away from too much car travel (“Paris bans driving due to smog,” passage 10). Drastic measures such as these can decrease pollution levels significantly, highlighting the potential benefit of striving for a car-limited society.\\n\\nLimiting car usage, however, requires more than just grassroots community initiatives; it requires systemic changes to transportation policy. As noted in \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, contends that changes in transportation policies that lessens the dependence on cars is necessary for sustainable development (passage 7).\\n\\nIn conclusion, the advantages of limiting car use are multi-faceted. As examples from cities like Vauban and Bogota demonstrate, reducing car usage can better the environment, increase social interaction, and reshape urban design. It is clear that the current momentum behind reducing reliance on cars must continue for the benefit of our communities and the planet as a whole. These aforementioned examples serve as a beckon to achieve such a sustainable global society.Dear Senator, There has been some recent heat on the topic of the Electoral College. I believe that it is only fair to keep the Electoral College. Although some voters may be upset with the fact that they don\\'t define who wins the presidential election, it is best that way. If there was no Electoral College people with no actual idea of whats going on would vote, and that could have a negative affect. Also if there was no Electoral College there would be an unfair amount of votes in larger states. The last reason is Swing States, which is also a very important part of the voting process.\\n\\nFirst and Foremost, the Electoral College may make voters feel like they have no input on the election, but really they decide who the Electoral voters choose. Without Electoral voters, there would be indecisive people voting for a candidate they know nothing about. For example, many young voters base their votes off of popular opinion, not what they think is actually right. If there was no Electoral College, the Nation could be in a lot of trouble because many votes would be casted off of popular opinion. So it is good to have some control over what happens and who becomes president, but I think having the full decision to vote for whomever, and have it count, is overdoing it.\\n\\nSecondly, I believe that having the Electoral College is great because, without it larger states would have more of a say on who becomes president. This would be very unfair to the smaller states for an obvious reason, population. Even though a few states might have a bigger population that doesn\\'t particularly mean that everyone in the state will vote. There are still \"independent voters\". For example, as stated in paragraph twentyone, the election voting in Florida was very close and relied a lot on popular votes. Florida ended up getting twentynine electoral votes, compared to Wyoming who only got three electoral votes. State size does matter because larger states will typically always get more attention from the presidential candidates than smaller ones.\\n\\nLastly, The Electoral College is a very important part of our voting process becaue of Swing States. As stated in paragraph twenty, voters in tossup states are \"more likely to listen to the campaign and the competing candidates\". These voters know that their votes wont make much of an impression on the election, but pay the most attention anyways. People claim that the most involved voters should be able to decide the elections. Although they don\\'t have much of a say it is nice to know that people do care about the elections and do pay close attention to what is going on.\\n\\nTo conclude my previously stated reasons, I believe that having the Electoral College is a crucial part of the system. Because without it the nation would have so many voters that only cast their votes based off of popular opinion. Also without it larger states would have more of an affect on the votes than the smaller states do. Finally, Swing States are a very important part of voting because voters who know what is going on and actually pay attention do have one of the biggest affects.Electoral college is a dictator, boss, or lottery! It\\'s unfair. It is the duty and privilege of the people to select our government leader. We should choose based on our point of view. The second source conveys effective points to consider, such as, directly voting for the president and the disaster factor. It also informs us that, even though unlikely, there is possibility of a tie.\\n\\nDirectly voting for a president is an issue addressed in both source 2 and 3. They agree that technically, we\\'re not really voting for a president. The second source tells us that when we vote, it is actually sent to the state elector, and it is they electors who vote for the president. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer voting directly over our system now. Even though source 3 gives us reasons to keep the electoral college, it will support us when we say we aren\\'t actually voting for the president directly.\\n\\nSource 2 gives us the \"single best argument\" against the elector college as what it refers to as the disaster factor. It uses the fiasco of 2000, the biggest election crisis in a century, as an example of why we are so lucky. The state legislatures were technically responsible for picking electors and they didn\\'t always have to listen or acknowledge the people\\'s opinionvote. It takes us further back by giving an example of segregationists back in 1960 where John F. Kennedy almost lost the popular vote of Louisiana when their legislature replaced Democratic electors with new ones that opposed him Kennedy. What source 2 calls \"faithless\" electors, electors who dont believe that their candidate will win hence faithless, have occasionly voted in favor of their choice, disregarding the decision of the people.\\n\\nThe third source gives us five reasons in favor of the electoral college method. Even though we don\\'t directly vote, the party chooses the electors and trust that they will select the voted nominee, and it ensures us that the trust is almost never deceived. Disputes over the outcome because of an Electoral College Vote is possible, but not as likely as the popular vote. The next reason given informs us that a region doesnt have enough electoral votes to win the election for the president they favor. \"Swing States\" is another reason. It refers to states that can be persuaded and aren\\'t necessarily entitled to a particular candidate, so they will really pay attention to what the candidates have to say, their campaign. \"Big states\" is the fourth reason and is focused on population advantages. Meaning, a state with smaller population will have just as much impact on the election as one with a larger population, its equal. It is not necessarily a good thing when the last reason says \"The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast\". Wouldn\\'t that raise the risk of a tie? Though, it is extremely unlikely that a single vote may decide the president and voters in these elections want to express their opinion and prefernece.\\n\\nI am in favor of abolishment of the unfair, oldfashioned, and irrational electoral college method. Plus, reasons to keep this system arent as strong and factual as the reasons to abolish it.The Electoral college is a process in which the electors from the state pick the candidate they want according to who has the popular vote. Which can also be a very biased process. The Electoral College is not registered or monitored enough because if an elector from the state wanted to pick who they want to win they could and there isn\\'t really anything to stop them from doing so.\\n\\nWe the people should do away with the Electoral College and instead switch to a more regulated system like majority voting. whichever candidate that gets the most votes from the U.S. takes the win. that way we wouldnt have to worry about our electors for the states being sneaky because there wont be any electors. State legislature is responsible for picking the electors and the electors sometimes defy the will of the people and cast the vote for who they want to win just like when Richard Nixon only validated his opponents electors in 1960. The Electoral College would be a more just way of voting if the electors were well monitored and if every state shared the same weight in the vote but unfortunately, it\\'s not like that so it needs to be done away with.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is a unrestricted and very poorly regulated process, and it is a very unfair process. Because of the winnertakeall system. In 1968, if 41,971 voters voted a different way the election would have been deadlocked. In 1976, if roughly 5,500 voters in Ohio and about 3,600 voters in Hawaii had voted for a different person the election would have been a tie. And usually the bigger states are the only ones to actually see their candidates because the candidates dont neccesarily visit states with very few electoral votes because they wont help them as much instead, they visit the \"swing states\", the states that have a bigger weight in the presidential election.\\n\\nHowever, on the other side the people that want to keep it are the ones that look at the few good things not the bad things. Of those helpful things that comes with the electoral collegee is it majorly decreases the chance of a runoff election in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral collegee also puts out a certainty of outcome because there is less likely to be a dispute over the outcome in a popular vote then a dispute over an Electoral College vote.\\n\\nOf course, in life there is always at least some good in things like the Electoral College but in this situation is does more harm then good. It is an overall unfair process because some states are less noticed because of how few electoral votes they hold and also because of the electors not being monitored on the vote they cast for their state. The Electoral College should be doen away with and as a united country we shall adopt a more fair, equal , and all together well monitored system of voting.Thousands of Americans use their own car or a vehicle as their main transportation in their every day lives. No one seems to look at how cars are actually destroying the environment ,rather then helping it. Mainly since the fuel that is given off from a vehicles engine is effecting the environment in a negative way. In all reality the reason why we as humans use our own vehicles is because its a faster way of transportation and carries us to our destination. This is why limiting car usage will be beneficial money wise and create a healthier environment.\\n\\nReducing the car usage is beneficial to creating a cleaner and safer environment. Not only will this effect the environment but your life as well. According to source 1 it states,\" Passengers cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe.\" Based on this fact I can acknowledge the fact of how automobiles can effect the greenhouse. The greenhouse is a cycle in which can have a huge impact on our environment. If we destroy that then that may result in even more damages that are caused now. It also states, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France , after five days of intensifying smog...\" In result, the smog then continued to places such as Bejing, China. Which I personally would consider to be a horrific thing, considering China is very congested already and is one of the most pollued cities in the world. Some may argue of the fact that car usage is their main way from going to point A to point B , but there is proof that is effecting the cities around us. Experts have concluded that there is about 50 percent car intensive areas located in the United States. This is why car usage should be reduced to have create a better environment.\\n\\nThe suburbs are taking action to create denser cities. The purpose of having denser cities is to have a low suburban life. In source 1 it states, \" In this new approach , stores are placed a walk away, on main street, rather than in malls along some distant highways.\" This experiment will help to encourage more ways to attempt public transportation. For instance, riding your bicycle once in a blue moon. Not only are you saving money but you are preventing less traffic from occurring in your area. Some may argue having a low suburban life can be hard to adapt to but it will provide a safer environment. Especially since you are one step closer to making the world less polluted then it already is. I personally would agree on occasionally using a different way to get to my destination. It will not only benefit me in the long run but also cause less chaos on the road. It also states in the text,\" the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car \"reduced communties\", and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.\" This means that the Environmental Agency are starting to promote reducing car in certain communities. Some may argue why is there a need to reduce the amount of cars in a community ,but on the other hand that community may be over populated or congested of cars. If this is so, then this will just have another negative impact of the environment. The purpose of the program is to benefit the area you are and to lessen then the issue of car usages. All in all, the suburbs are taking action to create denser cities.\\n\\nPrograms are also being created to spread the news of Car Free day. The purpose for Care Free day in Bogota , Columbia is a day you participate in to prevent traffic jams. For example, In source 3 it states, \"..millions of Colombians hiked, biked, and skated or took buses to work during a car free day.\" This day isn\\'t ment for people who live in Bogota, Colombia but they are trying to influence this tradition in several other countires. Other may agree of this day being pointless , but I can see this having a huge impact on the world. Sooner or later this day will become a tradition not only in several other countries but also in the United States. it also states in source 3,\" Its a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pulltion, said a bussniessman.\" Especially since it rained on the Car free day this didnt stop nor discourage anyone from participating in the event. The event turned out to be a huge success and reduced the amount of smog that day. In my perspective we are all come together as one to build our community together. It takes more thenone person to have such a huge impact on the world. The goal if to lessen the usage of car to have a positive effect on the environment. The influence of the Car free day is just one step closer to reaching that goal. This will is why programs are being creates to spread the news of Car free day.\\n\\nAfter looking of the causes and effects of limiting car usage , it all comes down to having a big influence on the world. It takes one area such as Bogota, Columbia to have a huge impact. In our every day lives , our car is our main resource for transportation, but this should change. Not only are you capable of helping to have a postive effect on the environment but so am I. This just shows how if we are all willing to come together as a community, we are capable of creating a healthier environment. This is why the world should influence limiting car usage.Dear Senator, If you were to question U.S. citizens about what an electoral college is, what would they say? Most of them don\\'t even know its a process established in the Constitution in which electors \"vote for president and vice president,\" and then are counted by the Congress Source 1, paragraph 1. They don\\'t realize that their votes can be overridden by these votes. And those, if the very few, who do get it, are opposed. They would prefer another system, a more modernized system, and are disgruntled about how unfair the system is, not only about how the electors are chosen but how the larger states have an advantage in votes and in information.\\n\\nMost voters are opposed to such systems, according to Source Two, \"... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now,\" paragraph 9. Yet we still have the Electoral Colleges going. As active voters in todays society, we call for a fair system. We want, no, we need, to be treated fairly and not overridden.\\n\\nWe need a system us as people can control ourselves. As in Source Two, I will ask you the question, \"Who picks the electors in the first place?\" Certainly not the citizens as a whole, most of the time its picked by the state government in some shape or form, but sometimes, even the presidential candidates themselves can pick them paragraph 10! As well as in Source Three, where its clearly pointed out that \"... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people,\" paragraph 15. It\\'s outrageous how easily they can pull the wool over our eyes, and even worse how we let them. But no more.\\n\\nAs you probably already know, each state\\'s \"...entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation...\" Source One, paragraph 3. Most representatives spend most of their time campaigning in places like New York and California that the small states such as Rhode Island arent even visited. \"In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see candidates at all...\" and that campaign was refered to as a \"fiasco\" in which the Electoral College caused a dispute Selection 2, paragraph 13. This leaves the smaller states less informed and more likely to vote to the exact opposite of what they want, and yet they still have as much say in the vote. In Selection Three, it is said that the swing states or larger ones \"... are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates,\" paragraph 20.\\n\\nSelection Two points out something very important that should be stressed, \"... each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 5000,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 represantatives from California, who represnt 35 million votes,\" paragraph 12. This shows the citizens aren\\'t really being represented properly.\\n\\nAltough many downfalls, \"The Electorial College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states... lose\" and \"avoids the problem of elections in which no one recieves a majority of the votes cast,\"Source Three, paragragh 21 and 22. Yet still there can be holes poked in that, and all though unlikely, theres an even amount of votes so the vote could be split 5050. Just imagine the chaos we could be thrown into.\\n\\nTherefor, as a concerned citizen speaking as the voice of others, we demand a better system, for a simplerly system, for an equal system, for a system we can control ourselves. We demand for a direct system! So I ask, please, for you to speak to your friends, and speak out for your people, and put an end to the Electorial Colleges.\\n\\nSincerly, A concerned citizen.Throughout the past century car usage has exploded from a luxury available only to the highest echelon of society to a tool almost essential to life. Although cars are convenient there are many downsides to having them. Some reasons a society that limits car use could be beneficial are: expenses, environmental costs, and health degredation. Hopefully together we can curb car usage and lead the way for a cheaper, greener, and healthier future.\\n\\nIts a known fact that cars are expensive, but when you add up all of the costs how much is really spent. Especially for younger drivers insurance is a ludicrous expense, often totalling hundreds of dollars per month. Another expense, obviously, is gas. Gas may be at a 5 year low right now but the slightest instability in oil producing countries could cause prices to skyrocket. Still if you add in the cost of the car your looking at a highly expensive way of living. Life obviously could be less expensive without car use.\\n\\nAnother illeffect of car use is environmental impact. car emissions are responsible for up to 50 percent of total green house gas emissions in some states. Using cars is not good for the environment. Cars pollute are atmosphere and can accelerate the rate of ozone layer deterioration. They also, indirectly, damage habitats by requiring new roads and highways to be built thus disturbing ecosystems. Automobiles also use large quantities of petroleum a finite and ever necessary resource in this global world. Car usage needs to be drastically reduced in order to preserve the environment.\\n\\nHealth issues can also develop from overusing cars. For instance, by looking at cultures that do not use cars it is evident that less children with autism are born to said peoples, such as the Amish. Another benefit of not using cars is exercise. People that drive instead of walking or bicycling are not only becoming more obese they are also putting themselves at an elevated risk for heart disease. Car accidents are one of the highest causes of premature death in the united states thus if people drove less these accidents would occur far less often. The choice seems clear a carless society is more healthy for all.\\n\\nAll in all, although cars may have benefits, the drawbacks of having them far out way any of said benefits. Car usage is expensive, bad for the environment and unhealthy. Together, society must ultimately decide whether life with automobiles is worth it and live with the consequences.\"Congestionwas down 60% in the capital of france after five days of intensifying smog\" duffer par.14. have you ever thought how bad cars are for this planet?\\n\\n\"Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\"plaza par.24. I think it is a good idea to banned cars for a few days. This is my opinion because if we take cars away then people will see how much more clear the air is, how much easier it is to breath, what good excersie it is for you, it will open some peoples minds about how the environment works and how bad cars are for our economy. \"These people are generating a revolutionary change and this is crossing borders\"rivera par.26. It is good because there is so much fog and pollution in the air that it is bad for society and how it is bad for us and the planet that we live on.\\n\\n\"americas love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. when adjusting to the population growth\" rosenthal par.32.people are realizing that their love with their cars isnt as big as their love for their own life and for their friends and family lives.\"as of april 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9% below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lines in the recession, because cashstrapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway\"rosenthal par.32. people now a days dont have enough money to by a car for themselves because there arent enough jobs for all the people because of the big population growth of america.\\n\\npeople are using technology to talk to people, and this means that people dont have to drive as often to go talk to someone. \"demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. there hasa been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds gettin a license\"siva par.38. younger people dont really want to drive to places if they can just talk to people on the phone. some people of this society are lazy because they dont want to get up and go places when they have their phones, but sometimes its for a good reason even if they dont know it they are not polluting the air as much as they would be if they drove to their friendsfamily house.\\n\\nhow do you feel about how cars are affecting this planet and the way it works. these ideas and actions people are taking are going around the globe and it is saving the earth one day at a time with one little idea.Since World War II we have been heavily dependent on the modern day transportation: the car. Some say the car is an innovative and convenient method of transportation, while others say that it will be the end of the environment. As the evidence indicates, there are advantages to limiting car usage.\\n\\nDissenters of the idea claim to say that limiting car usage will negatively impact the car industry, but it doesn\\'t. Limiting car usage doesn\\'t mean that people will have to stop buying cars it simply means that they will have to find a different method of transportation. Source 2 says that in Paris on certain days motorist, who had an odd or even license plate number, had to leave their cars at home and find an alternative method of transportation. Does the evidence demonstrate an impact to car companies? Did they have a financial deficit due to their lack of buyers? The answer is simple: no, because they didn\\'t ban the use of cars. Also, car companies can well benefit from places that limit car usage but allow hybrid cars this allows for an increase in revenue. Most car companies in today\\'s society model hybrid cars that run on primarily electricity and gas. In Paris, they made exceptions \"for plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers Source 2\". These exceptions actually promote the buying of hybrid cars! This will boost the economic profit of the car companies, not damage it. Limiting car usage does not affect car companies, but instead supports it.\\n\\nThe limitation of car usage betters the environment. Cars emit greenhouse gases in the atmosphere faster than they can be removed. This causes health problems in living organisms and pollution of ecosystems. Cars are liable for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in areas in the U.S. as Source 1 states. People are playing with the balance of nature and if its not fixed then humans are as good as dead this is why the implementation of limiting car usage benefits people. The effects of this can be seen in Bogota, Colombia, whose goal is to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation Source 3, and Paris, where intense smog covered the enitre city: \"The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.Source 2\" The source explains that cold nights and warm days trapped in car emissions and after a few days of reducing car usage the air cleared up. This shows the effectiveness of the limiations of car usage.\\n\\nThe limiting of cars also boosts community wellness. The people who experienced this regulation had positive views on the matter and even on rainy days they participated! Bogota, Colombia has gone into its third year of banning cars and the turnouts of the pariticipation were large, with two other Colombian cities joining and municipal authorities from other countries to view the event Source 3. The evidence show that limiting cars wasn\\'t opposed by the people, in fact, other countries were wanting to get in on the action. This limiting of car usage really cuts down on traffic congestion and new community projects have been established to ease the transition to alternative transportation. Heidrun Walter, mentioned in Source 1, syas that when she had her car she always tense and stressed and is happy with the change. The source also mentions that the \"swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor Source 1.\" This shows that the limitation of car usage greatly enchances the wellness of the community and promotes a safe and stressfree environment for the people.\\n\\nIn summation, the limitation of car usage doesn\\'t negatively impact car companies, but instead increases hybrid car sale revenue, echances community wellness, betters the environment. The things that can be accomplished with this regulation only has benefits for everyone.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my strong support for keeping the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial aspect of our democratic process that should be preserved. In this letter, I will outline the reasons why the Electoral College should be retained based on information from various sources.\\n\\nThe Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and election by popular vote. According to the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College consists of 538 electors who vote for the President and Vice-President. Each state is allotted a number of electors equal to the sum of its congressional delegation (members in the House of Representatives plus two Senators). This system ensures that both the popular vote and the representation of each state are taken into account in electing the President. (\"What Is the Electoral College?\", Office of the Federal Register)\\n\\nOne of the main arguments against the Electoral College is the claim that it is undemocratic. However, Judge Richard A. Posner argues that it actually increases certainty of outcome. He points out that the winner of the Electoral College vote usually reflects the winner of the popular vote, and in rare cases where the popular vote winner does not win the electoral vote, it creates a landslide victory for the winner. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could result in more disputes and recounts, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the election. (\"In Defense of the Electoral College\", Judge Richard A. Posner)\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal, as mentioned by Judge Posner. Candidates need to have support from multiple regions in order to win the electoral vote. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas and neglecting the interests of voters in less populous regions. The Electoral College requires candidates to campaign in swing states, which encourages them to address the concerns and needs of a diverse range of voters. This leads to a more inclusive governance and reduces the risk of polarization. (\"In Defense of the Electoral College\", Judge Richard A. Posner)\\n\\nIn addition, the Electoral College provides more attention to states with larger populations, as discussed by Judge Posner. This helps to balance the political influence of large and small states, as larger states receive more attention during the campaign due to their higher number of electoral votes. This ensures that the concerns and interests of citizens in both small and large states are taken into account when electing the President. (\"In Defense of the Electoral College\", Judge Richard A. Posner)\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, preventing further complication of the election process. Under this system, a clear winner is typically determined, even if they do not have a majority of the popular vote. This strengthens the stability and efficiency of the election process by eliminating the need for additional rounds of voting. (\"In Defense of the Electoral College\", Judge Richard A. Posner)\\n\\nWhile opponents argue that the Electoral College discourages voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, it is important to note that voter turnout is not solely driven by the belief that one vote can decide an election. Rather, voters participate to express their political preference. The Electoral College system ensures that the concerns of citizens in all states are taken into account through the allocation of electors, maintaining a balanced representation across the nation. (\"In Defense of the Electoral College\", Judge Richard A. Posner)\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College should be retained as the method for electing the President of the United States. It is a fair and inclusive system that ensures representation for all states, increases certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, the benefits it provides outweigh the potential drawbacks. I urge you to consider these arguments and support the preservation of the Electoral College.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name][Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Full Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nDear Senator [Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides important benefits that ensure fairness, certainty of outcomes, and regional representation in presidential elections.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College guarantees the certainty of outcomes in presidential elections. As explained by Judge Richard A. Posner, under the Electoral College system, the winning candidate\\'s share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome are less likely to occur compared to a direct popular vote. Moreover, because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a slight plurality in a state can result in a landslide electoral vote victory.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents the entire nation, not just certain regions. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents a candidate with only regional support from becoming President. This is crucial for the successful governance and representation of the interests of all Americans. As Judge Posner argues, candidates with only regional appeal are unlikely to be successful presidents, as residents of other regions may feel disenfranchised and believe that the President does not consider their interests.\\n\\nThe Electoral College\\'s focus on swing states also promotes a more informed electorate. By concentrating campaign efforts on toss-up states, candidates are incentivized to engage with and understand the concerns of voters in these states. As a result, voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and become more thoughtful voters. This ensures that the election is decided by those who have received the most information and attention from the candidates.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states. As Judge Posner highlights, the Electoral College restores some weight to large states in the political balance, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Without the Electoral College, candidates would focus predominantly on heavily populated states and neglect the interests of smaller states. By maintaining the Electoral College, presidential campaigns are forced to consider the concerns of citizens from all states, regardless of their population size.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges, avoiding the complications and costs associated with run-off elections. This ensures that the election process remains efficient and that the will of the majority is decisive.\\n\\nWhile some argue that the Electoral College discourages potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the high voter turnout in presidential elections indicates that most voters are motivated by the desire to express a political preference rather than the belief that their single vote can decide the outcome. The Electoral College system has not deterred Americans from exercising their right to vote.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College plays a vital role in our democracy by providing fairness, certainty of outcomes, regional representation, and an informed electorate. It balances the interests of both large and small states, ensuring that the President truly represents the entirety of our nation. I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College system, as it continues to serve the best interests of our country and its citizens.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your continued leadership and support.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Cars have become a part of everyday life over the years. We depend on them for transportation from one place to the next. Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live without a car? Well, globally, changes are being made. There have been car bans and even a community that completely quit using cars. There are advantages of limiting car usage.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can lead to a less stressful life. The residents of Vauban, Germany, have taken a huge step. They have given up their cars. As stated in the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\",70 percent of vaughn\\'s families do not own cars. A statement from a local resident, also found in the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", says, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\". The limit on car usage has allowed the residents to go back to a simpler life. A life where everyday noises such as children playing and bicycle wheels rollingalong the pavement can be heard.\\n\\nLimiting car usage impacts the environment greatly in a positive way. The article titled \"The End of Car Culture\" states, \"...transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants\".Cars are a leading cause of air pollution around the world. For example, the smog in Paris, France, had gotten so bad that they had to put a temporary partial ban on driving. Due to this rule, congestion was down 60 percent. Cutting back on the usage of cars would have an incredible impact on global air pollution. A simple step in the right direction can change the environment is a positive way.\\n\\nBeing happier and decreasing air pollution are only two advantages of limiting car usage. There is a lot that can come from taking cars out of our daily routines. It may be hard to adjust at first but the impact it would have on the earth would be worth it. Taking responsibility and care of our earth is a change that needs to happen. Itis a possible and reasonable solution to our pollution problem.Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing as a concerned citizen to discuss the on-going debate regarding the retention of the Electoral College or shifting to a popular vote system for Presidential Elections. I am of the stronger belief that maintaining our current system of the Electoral College is beneficial for stable and balanced representation.\\n\\nThe Electoral College, as established in the Constitution, provides a balance between the election of the President by Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. This mechanism focuses on the objective of enhancing the voice of each state, particularly smaller ones who otherwise may be undermined in a simple popular vote system.\\n\\nWhile the detractors claim it can be confusing for voters and lends a higher risk of “faithless” electors, occurrences of such events are rare, as trust is rarely betrayed within the established elector slates of each party. Moreover, historically, discrepancies between the popular vote and electoral vote are extremely infrequent, with only five instances since the founding of our country.\\n\\nThere are several practical reasons for preserving the Electoral College. Firstly, it provides a certainty of outcome. The existence of a winner-take-all rule in nearly all states inherently reduces the likelihood of a dispute over popular vote. Secondly, it demands a nationwide appeal from a presidential candidate, acknowledging that no single region can elect a president, ensuring a balanced and fair representation.\\n\\nCritics argue that this system leads candidates to focus only on swing states during campaigns, minimizing the focus on more certain states. However, while swing states may receive more focus during campaigns, it can be argued that energizing voters in these crucial states leads to higher information dissemination and therefore a more thoughtfully informed electorate.\\n\\nFinally, the Electoral College helps overcome a shortfall in the representation of larger states due to the equal representation of votes in the Senate. For instance, a win in a populous state like Florida would give a nominee 29 electoral votes, while the same win margin in Wyoming would result in just 3 votes. \\n\\nWhile critics suggest that the Electoral College is outdated and irrational, I believe we should perceive it as a measure to preserve our federative system and safety guard the interests of smaller states, ensuring that the candidate who becomes president truly represents all sections of our country. Therefore, I kindly urge your support in advocating for the maintenance of the Electoral College.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your Name]In many places around the world people own cars and drive around almost every day. But what many people dont know is that cars can release harmful gases that can hurt the earth\\'s environments. Three reasons why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it prevents traffic, it helps the environment and your community, and we dont really need cars to live our everyday lives.\\n\\nLimiting car usage in your community is good because it prevents traffic. Everyday, people use their cars to go places even if the place their going to is down the street and that causes traffic some times. For example, in Paris there has been days of nearrecord pollution due to traffic so Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from pollution. They said every Monday motorist with evennumbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at home or face a 22 euro fine. This ban helped because congestion dropped 60 percent in the capital of France just after five days of the ban was set.\\n\\nAnother reason why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it helps prevent pollution to the air around you. Cars can release gasses that can harm the earths environment and the community around you. Which is why in the United States the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting \"car reduced\" communities much like the one in Vauban, Germany. These \"car Free\" communities consist of a small town where the usage of cars is illegal, you are not even allowed to own homes with a garage in it. This is very good for the environment and can prevent air pollution.\\n\\nWe should limit how often we use cars because we dont really need them to get around and many countries believe so too. For example in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that was set to spread out to other countries, during this program millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. One reason why these people might have done this is because any one who violated this rule would have been fined 25 but the main goal for this was to prevent smog in their countries environment. The turn out however was huge! Even when there was rain it didn\\'t stop them. The mayor of Bogota said \"The rain hasn\\'t stopped people from participating\" and now for the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event.\\n\\nThere are many reasons why we should limit the usage of cars in our communities because it prevents traffic , helps the environment and because we dont really need to use cars so often , take Colombia for example. So lets take action and follow the steps that many countires and communities are taking to help our communities.Theres so many roads in the world but traffic still exists. Ever think about the amount of cars in your neighborhood?, dont you think thats probably the reason why? In the Sources 1,2,3 , and 4 all emphasizes on how having a limit of car usage can be an great advantage to society. I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.\\n\\nWith that being said , Limiting car use lowers air pollution. I agree with this because the less cars driven leads to less burning fuel. According to the passage by Robert Duffer paragraph 10 states that \"After days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\"Due to the high population in Paris and numerous amount of the owning a vehicle causes massive car pollution. Having massive car pollution can be dangerous, this inherits sickness, stress and diseases. referring to the source \"Carfree Day is spinning into a big hit in bogota,Columbia\" Mayor Of Bogota Antanas Mockus stated that \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\" As he rode a two seater bike with his wife. The Mayor in this content speaks the absolute truth. As you walk to your destination in the nice warm air you relive stress and diseases that were causing you to be sick before. Those are the reasons why i think limiting car usage lowers the pollution.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage decreases traffic. This is true because if there is 5 people going to the same place you are and all of you guys drive in that one car or bus that reduces the traffic. Micheal siva In Source 4 The end of car Culture elaborate on that by saying \"What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before downturn, I Think that means something more fundamental is going on.\"What or. siva means by this is that everyone should only have a certain amount of car per household and person Which will also lower the traffic. Traffic in paris is very long but due to the carfree act traffic was reduces. from reading source 2 by Robert Duffer ,it states \"Congestion was down 60 % in the capital of france Paris, after five days of intensifying smong.\" Just in five days of no driving the air is already unpolluted imageded if you drived five days all day. Those are the reasons why i think that Limiting car usage is an advantage.\\n\\nTo Conclude,I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my position on the matter of the Electoral College and its continued existence or potential replacement by a popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments presented in various texts, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained. In this letter, I will present my claim, address counterclaims, provide evidence from multiple sources, and avoid over-reliance on a single source.\\n\\nThe Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of electors, the voting process by electors for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. Each state\\'s allotment of electors is based on its Congressional delegation, ensuring fair representation (Passage 1).\\n\\nOne counterclaim against the Electoral College is that it is undemocratic. However, it is essential to note that democracy does not always mean direct popular vote but can also include representative democracy. The electors, selected by the political parties, have a responsibility to vote for their party\\'s nominee, ensuring that the will of the people is represented (Passage 15).\\n\\nThe first reason to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike in a direct popular vote system, disputes over the electoral vote outcome are considerably less likely due to the winner-take-all allocation of electoral votes in most states (Passage 18). This ensures a decisive result and reduces the possibility of extensive recounts or legal challenges, as seen in the 2000 election.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also serves as a means to ensure that the President has trans-regional appeal (Passage 19). No single region in the country possesses enough electoral votes to elect a President, thereby compelling candidates to campaign in various states across different regions. This requirement promotes a broader understanding of regional interests and prevents the disenfranchisement that would occur if a candidate campaigned only in the regions where they were already popular.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, where the election outcome is uncertain (Passage 20). By prioritizing these states, candidates must engage voters who are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, have the final say in the election.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also restores some balance to the political influence of large states compared to small states (Passage 21). While the popular vote would allow candidates to focus solely on large population centers, the Electoral College system forces candidates to consider the concerns of smaller states and gives them disproportionately more attention in the campaign process. This ensures that the interests of citizens living in less populated states are not ignored.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College addresses the issue of run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner (Passage 22). This eliminates the need for the complexities and expenses associated with additional voting rounds. Through this system, the President who garners the most electoral votes is declared the winner, ensuring a decisive outcome.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College, including certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, swing states, balancing the political influence, and avoiding run-off elections, outweigh the counterarguments. The Electoral College provides a fair representation of voters\\' needs and interests while maintaining the stability and integrity of the presidential election process. It ensures that all states have a voice and that regions with diverse interests are considered.\\n\\nThank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I trust that you will take into account the practical reasons supporting the retention of the Electoral College. If you have any further questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Limiting car usage will give us many benefits. A projects such as Vauban and BOGOTA were completed to show us the multitude of advantages received from it.\\n\\nReducing car usage would be excellent for our environment. Research shows us that \"passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States\"Rosenthal. Our world is very materialistic and sometimes we forget that to even have life, we must have the environment. \"Cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities\"Rosenthal. Therefore, limiting the amount of cars would allow us to have more efficient green houses, and more land area for plants.\\n\\nMoney is also a huge factor here. The government spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in the transportation department. By lowering the number of cars on the road, the less wear and tear is done to them. This would be beneficial in many departments because then we would have more money for the things we need but cannot afford in our area and or country. Infact, \"80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transportation\"Rosenthal.\\n\\nDriving also causes stress. Traffic jams, new or confusing road signs, attitudes of passengers, are all distribution of stress, especially when you get lost! If the amount of driving we did by ourselves was cut back, we could also cut back stress. BOGOTA helps to prove this, and even says that violaters of no car day were \"fined 25Selsky.\\n\\nLastly, if we do not put a stop to so much driving, our personal health may be in risk. According to souce 4, \"the car industry is the second largest in the world.\" This means that the air is constantly being polluted with exhuast. Which also means that what\\'s in your lungs at this very moment, could be a lot more than just oxygen. It\\'s very scary to think that the same chemicals it takes to run your car, might just be what\\'s floating around in your body. This could lead to multiple health problems and future diseases. Therefore, this issue needs to be taken control of immediately.\\n\\nIn conclusion, reducing car usage would be an amazing thing to do for oursleves and the people around us. We would save our air and bodies from being polluted, we would save money, and save time not stressing out. Who doesn\\'t want these things? Limiting car usage would be a fantastic idea.Between years 2001 and 2009 driving by young people has decreased 23 percent because of new innovations including compact suburbs, more bicycle paths and public transportation. There are many benefits for limiting your car usage including better moods and more compact easily accessible cities, a large decrease in pollution and its cheaper.\\n\\nIn Vauban, Germany, Majority of there population of over five thousand have given up cars for simple reasons. A resident of Vauban stated that while using her car she felt , \" tense\" and that \"Im much happier this way\". having a car can be very stressful because you have to be alert one hundred percent of the time. You also have to deal with other drivers on the road who might not be as responsible as yourself. One big reason for leaving your car behind could be the traffic jam. traffic jams are frustrating and cause bad moods and later on accidents. Another advantage is a more compact way of living. In Vauban, they have placed their shops on a walk way rather than in a mall to increase their accessibility to pedestrians and bike riders.\\n\\nPollution has become a large threat to the world today because of cars and their exhaust. Cars are said to cause twelve percent of the greenhouse gases found in the atmosphere. Paris enforced a driving ban on monday for even numbered license plates because of the near record pollution problem in the city. These people had to leave their cars at home or be fined a thirtyone dollar ticket. many still disobeyed and some had their cars impounded. this shows us that car pollution is becoming out of hand, and limiting your car use can help the environment and lower the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\\n\\nAfter 2005, studies show that the rate of driving began decreasing because of the recession. Americans could not afford to buy brand new cars ,and people without jobs just couldnt buy a car at all. Cars are becoming expensive which is why peole are taking alternate roots. this decrease in car buying will hold up the car making companies but could give people more money to spend on other things.\\n\\nThroughout the years car use has decreased because of carless communities, new banning laws, the growing numbers of greenhouse gases, increasing costs and and the growing trend of walking, riding a bike, and using public transportation such as trains and buses.Dear Senator [Last Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing as a concerned student to weigh in on the debate that our nation has been having for many years now: the question of whether or not we should abolish the Electoral College and shift to direct elections as suggested by Bradford Plumer. It is my belief that we should maintain the Electoral College system.\\n\\nFirstly, as pointed out by Judge Richard Posner, the Electoral College offers a certainty of outcome that is less likely to be achieved through a popular vote. The system allows for a decisive victory, even in cases where the popular vote is narrowly split. By giving the winner of each state\\'s popular vote all the state\\'s electoral votes (with the exception of Nebraska and Maine), a clear winner can be determined without the potential long-drawn-out dispute that a close popular vote could cause.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College system requires presidential candidates to appeal across regions and to diverse groups of people. This ensures that presidents have a broad representation of our nation and do not cater to the interests of only one demographic or geographical area. If we elected our presidents purely via a popular vote, candidates could potentially focus only on high-population urban areas or specific interest groups, ignoring less populous regions and minority interests, thereby compromising the fundamental democratic principles of our nation.\\n\\nIt is important here to address the counter claims, one of them being the \"disaster factor\" as defined by Plumer. However, the rarity of these occurrences speaks volumes. There have been only a handful of instances like segregationists in Louisiana legislature trying to replace democratic electors or faithless electors casting their vote for someone other than their party\\'s candidate. These few occurrences do not justify the eradication of the entire system.\\n\\nIt is also argued that the focus on swing states by the candidates is detrimental. However, the residents of the swing states tend to be the ones paying most attention and end up being the most informed and thoughtful voters; the ones whose votes ultimately decide the election. This is, to me, a strength of the Electoral College, not a flaw.\\n\\nAs for the possibility of a \"tie\" scenario in the Electoral College, it has never happened in the entire history of U.S. presidential elections. While technically possible, the likelihood of a coin-flip tie when millions of votes are cast is virtually zero.\\n\\nWhile the direct election method seems undeniably democratic, remnants of representative democracy like the Electoral College hold firm on the importance of achieving a balance between pure majority rule and the protection of minority interests and federalism. The framers of our constitution built in this balance, and we would be wise to maintain it.\\n\\nI sincerely hope that as my state Senator, you will consider these points when deliberating on this matter both in our state and within Congress.\\n\\nBest,\\n[Your Full Name]Dear senator, We should change the electoral college to an election by popular votes for the president of the united states.\\n\\nI believe that everyone should have a say in who their future president should be not just a group of selected officials. Sure some of the peoples choices may end up bias or thoughtless but atleast they get to feel as if their a part of the state. like stated in \"what\\'s wrong with the electoral college\" sentence 11 \"Those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" meaning that sometimes the chosen electors neglect their positions and use it the wrong way. The selected electors may end up going against the people andor choose a bias decision. No matter how you look at it their still human and they will make mistakes.\\n\\nElectoral college shouldn\\'t only allow government official or \"qualified\" citizens to bare that huge responsibility because if they make one wrong move then everyone will blame them but if we have popular vote everyone will have a say in the presidential voting. If we have electoral votes your only giving specific people power while as the other citizens sit down to watch complete stranges balance their countries future in their hands. like stated in \"what\\'s wrong with electoral college\" sentence 13 \"At the most basic level ,the electoral college is unfair to voters\" meaning that electoral votes is unjustified to the people.\\n\\nElectoral votes should be abolished because it isn\\'t justified for all of those hardworking citizens who always pay their respects to this country. It even states in \"what\\'s wrong with electoral college\" sentence 14 \" It\\'s official : The electoral college is unfair ,outdated, and irrational.\" meaning that the electoral college has been here long enough, it\\'s not justified ,and it\\'s irrational. Something like that should no longer exist. The citizens should have a say in who will become their new president. They should have a majority vote.\\n\\nLike stated in \"choosing the president\" sentence 15 \"the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism\"meaning that the electoral college is really old and we no longer have any need for it. The electoral college is something that was meant for the past. There may have been some sort of issue that they could not properly deal with ,so they created the electoral college in order to deal with it. But now we have more advance ways of doing stuff so we don\\'t need electoral college any more. We can now change our ways for voting so that it\\'ll match our time and period.\\n\\nElectoral votes is filled with holesbias. So we should find a new way of chosing our new president who is willing to change our couontry for the best and not corrupt our country.People all over the world are saying goodbye to their cars and saying hello to different, oldfashioned ways of transportation. This new trend involves walking, bike riding, and other types of public transportation. Certain cities, like Vauban and Paris, have started to set limitations on car usage. These limitations include days where cars with specific license plates are not allowed to drive that day or even complete days where no driving is allowed, failure to follow these rules results in a fine. Most citizens of these towns have been following these rules and have found to be quite rewarding. These advantages include stress relief and a happier attitude, less greenhouse emission into the atmosphere, and a overall better environment. Limiting car usage is more beneficial than it is negative.\\n\\nOne of the most beneficial parts of not using a car often would be the loss of stress and a increase in a happy attitude. Most people who have participated in the limitation of car use have had positive feed back. One woman in Vauban, Germany, where most citizens are giving up their cars, said \"when I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\\' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.\" Rosenthal, 3. Another man in Bogota, Colombia participating in their carfree day said \"\\'It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress...\\' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife.\" Selsky, 24. All around people who have joined this trend have started to become happier and less stressed as the start to leave their cars behind.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage would be less greenhouse emission into the atmosphere. Cars play a huge part in greenhouse emission into the atmosphere, so limiting the usage would have such a positive result. According the the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive ares in the United States.\" Rosenthal, 5. Knowing that, cutting out cars would minimize the greenhouse gas emission a huge percent in certain regions, like the United States. The article The End of Car Culture discusses how the amount of people who own cars keeps getting progressively lower each year, which will help with greenhouse emission. After discussing statistics of the amount of people who own cars in America, the article goese on to say, \"If this pattern persists and many sociologoists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest sourse of America\\'s emissions...\" Rosenthal, 34. With limiting the amount of car usage the atmosphere will be exposed to a lot less greenhouse emission.\\n\\nOne huge advantage of limiting the usage of cars would be a overall better environment. Many cities are so polluted and have air filled with smog, like Beijing and Paris. Some of this smog comes from cars. Paris is doing something to stop their smog from becoming any worse, they are banning driving. \"On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day.\" Duffer, 11. A similar situation is happening in Bogota, Columbia. Bogota started a carfree day to help with their situation. \"The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines.\" Selsky, 21. These new limitations on car usage are going to help save the environment.\\n\\nOverall, the limitations that are being put on car usage have many advantages. The lack of car usage in certain areas is helping to create a better environment, give out less greenhouse emission, and give people a happy attitude. Putting limitations on car usage has benefited many areas and continues to benefit them now. Most of these places are continuing to progress and put more limitations on cars as they head into a nicer, brighter future.What is your point of view on this argument that we are discussing today here in the Sunshine State? The Florida Senator should consider keeping the Electoral College voting system to choose our President because the founding fathers of the United States established this system. The popular vote is terrible because in some cases it might be teens or young people that don\\'t know about politics or what they want to give to this country or state. They vote on the things that interest them, not the country. When you vote for anything, your main priority is \"Does this make the country a better place and will bring more benefits to the people in this country or state\"?\\n\\nThe Electoral College voting system is much easier to count who won because its a \"winnertakeall\" system. This can be seen when \" The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral vote\"Source 3. This example shows even tho the popular was very close, Obama still won Florida and got those 29 electoral votes. There is a another way people view theElectoral College and they say that the \"Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational\"Source 2. They also say the best argument against the Electoral College is the disaster factor.\\n\\nEach person has their own point of view about each thing but mine is that we should stay with the Electoral College system because it benefits the people in Florida and the United States.\\n\\nFor example, \"In 2012\\'s election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney.... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state\"Source 3. This shows a certainty of the outcome for that state. This also cause candidates to not spend their time in states \"they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states\"Source 2.\\n\\nTherefore, we should consider keeping the electoral College for various reasons. The Electoral College has been the voting system of our country all along. Why should we change the tradition that our founding fathers left for us? Eveything in life happens for a reason, I would appeciate it if you could the the Electoral College in this beautiful Sunshine State, Florida.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n\\nDear [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a direct popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that make it a vital part of our democracy.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As mentioned in \"In Defense of the Electoral College\" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College is likely to exceed their share of the popular vote. This helps avoid disputes over the outcome of the election, as was witnessed in the 2000 election. By allocating electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the Electoral College ensures that a candidate with a slight plurality in a state can achieve a landslide electoral-vote victory.\\n\\nAnother benefit of the Electoral College is that it promotes a candidate with trans-regional appeal. As noted by Judge Posner, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which encourages candidates to campaign across the country and appeal to a diverse range of voters. This results in a president who represents the interests of all regions, rather than just one particular area.\\n\\nThe system of swing states, in which candidates focus their campaign efforts on competitive states, is another advantage of the Electoral College. This was evident in the 2012 election, where candidates directed their attention towards toss-up states. This system of campaigning in swing states ensures that voters in these states have a greater impact on the outcome of the election, encouraging them to pay close attention to the candidates and make informed decisions. Consequently, the most thoughtful voters become the ones who decide the election.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College balances the weight of large states with the mal-apportionment of the Senate. As mentioned by Judge Posner, the Electoral College provides more attention from presidential candidates to large states, which have a greater share of electoral votes. This ensures that the interests of these populous states are not overshadowed by the smaller states and helps to maintain a balanced political system.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. As seen in the elections of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the candidates won the majority in the Electoral College despite having only a plurality of the popular vote. This system eliminates the need for complicated run-off elections and ensures a clear winner with a majority of the electoral votes.\\n\\nWhile some critics argue that the Electoral College can discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the high turnout in the 2012 election suggests that voters still want to express their political preferences, even if they don\\'t believe their vote will determine the outcome.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College is a fair and effective system for electing the President of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, focuses on swing states, balances the weight of large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. Therefore, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College and support its continuation.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Limiting car usage can be beneficial in many ways. For example, the air would be a lot less poluted if we reduced the amount of cars being used. In a German suburb that rarely ever uses cars, people report that it is less stressful to not own a car.\\n\\nThe advantages of limiting car usage is not only beneficial to people but also to the planet. If people were to limit their car usage, the amount of pollution and smog in the air would be reduced and not be such an issue Paris bans driving due to smog, P19.\\n\\nCongestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog Paris bans driving due to smog, P14.\\n\\n\"After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" Paris bans driving due to smog, P10. Regardless of the partial driving ban, almost 4,000 drivers were fined. This shows that some people do not really care about all the pollution they are bringing the Earth. Which gives people more reason not to limit car usage. If people are not going to try limiting down the usage, other poeple will follow that and not do so either. So limiting car usage is really important for the planet and for us.\\n\\nThe less cars we use the less smog there will be in the air.\\n\\nTrying to limit car usage is not a new thing, the day without car is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota, Colombia in the mid 1990s Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, P27. In Colombia, the rain did not stop the people from participating in the carfree day, and it had an effect in two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, which joined in the carfree day for the first time Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, P25. So the car free day is rapidly making its way into cities, so that it can help limit the amount of cars being used.\\n\\nLimiting car usage is very benefitial because it will also help keeping young people safe.\\n\\nResearcher have found that driving between young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 The end of car culture, P41. \"What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn\" The end of car culture, P33. \"If the pattern persisits... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportaion is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants.\" The end of culture, P34. If the usage of cars is reduced, people could be a lot happier than the are now. Since 2001, resarchers believe that young people do not make getting their licenses a priority anymore, which does improve the fact that people are getting a step closer to helping reduce the amount carbon in the air. If people could organize their schedual around being able to walk or take public transportation to the location they need to be at, there would be no need to use cars, to an extent of course. Not everyone can there their schedual to do that, but the more people that contribute to it the better.\\n\\n\"When i had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\" says Heidrun Walter Car free cities, P3. Limiting the amount of car usage will not only help to reduce the amount of carbon in the air, but it could also help the people live a happier life like Heidrun Walter. Although not everyone feels that way, whether people like it or not, it is better for them to reduce car usage not only for their sake but also for the worlds sake.\\n\\nIf car usage was to be limited, not only would the world be rid of more carbon, but it could also have a great impact on peoples lives.\\n\\n\"He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which \"pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commertial and public transporation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety\"\" The end of car culture, P43.\\n\\nEven though at the moment it is not the easiest task to get around, it would improve many things dealing with the environment, the economy, and the people.Dear senator, Imagine it being the year for choosing for a new president for the United States of America. You cast your vote, for which president you thought that would be best to run our country. After, you hear the results you become very disappointed , Because the president won not by the popular vote but by the electoral college. You become very angry and frustrated because the president that will now be running for America will not better our country by the things he said. Reasoning, that he won by the electoral college and not by popular vote, and you feel as if you dont feel as if it was not fair because you\\'re not really choosing based on the state laws and how the electors are selected. How would you feel if you were in a situation like this ?\\n\\nFurthermore, i think we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America. My reasoning being said is because when the president wins by popular vote it\\'s from what the american citizens want, not what the electors chose. When you choose by popular vote you also avoid many other things from occurring. For example, the electoral college is a method of selecting the president that may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. As explained in the text \" voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.\" Moreover, the electoral college is unfair to voters. candidates dont spend as time in states they know they have no chance of winning, and only focusing on the states that they do. As said in the text \" In a 2000 campaign , seventeen states dont see the candidates at all, including in rhode island and south carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. Making that hard for the people to see what there president wants to do for the country they have no idea because of the candidate too worried on winning and letting the citizens choose.\\n\\nTo elaborat on my claim, the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The disaster factor is what happened in the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis in a century , which allows the system for much worse. In the electoral college state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, and those electors would effect the will of the citizens. sometimes \"faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever thet please.\" Making another reason why the electoral college should\\'nt be here to stay.\\n\\nAlthough, keeping the electoral college may not be a good thing to do.The breeze of the late summer air, it\\'s fragrance of flowers and the occasional bakery wafting into our noses. The sounds of children safetly playing amongst themselves and soft chatters of people coincided with the smell. It seemed like an utterly new universe where we tread, thanks to no more pollution and the ruckus of vehicles beeping and swerving every now and then, the atmosphere was delightful. The advantages of banning cars or at least reducing them is that the carbon dioxide levels will decrease and business will bloom.\\n\\nTo begin with, banning carsreducing them will benefit our ecosystems and environments. Take Paris for example, they banned cars due to all of the smog and pollution it was emitting. Congestion, traffic, was down 60% after five days of intense smog it was worst than one of the most populated cities in the world, Beijing Source 2. That CO2 rises into the air, the atmosphere of Earth trapping all of that heat in, and it bounced back down at us. The climate would be more reasonable, there will be a less amount of traffic jams and people being late to work, and maybe some day, our Ozone Layer could replenish. Carlos Arturo Plaza from Source 3 stated, \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" We as a population don\\'t have to completely outlaw driving but more acts of carpooling and using public transportation will immensely reduce the CO2. We can all be able to give up something for the benefit of the common good, in Bogota, Columbia it has been three straight years that cars have been banned found in Source 3 and they have a population of a wopping seven million. Michael siva brings up a good point in Source 4 saying, \"What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn.\" Elisabeth Rosenthal states that, \"Mine 19 and 21 speaking of her children have not bothered to get a driver\\'s license, even though they both live in places where one could some in handy. They are interested, but it\\'s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends.\\n\\nAlongside with the bettering the environment, there is the sudden blooming of business and profit. With everyone on their feet and searching somewhere to hang , shop owners will be opening for business, and actually take part in the outside world. In Source 3, a valid point is relevant, \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restauraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" There will be a fluctuation of revenue throughout all these newly built shops, stores, entertainment centers, and restauraunts. People will be more active with running, walking, and biking around the citytown. In Bogota, Columbia according to Source 3 new paths have been opening up, \"It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city,\" stated by Mockus the city mayor. An ordinary person, Heidrun Walter, positively commented on the ban of cars, \"When I had a car, I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" Consider all the factors of health, one will be fully exercised on a daily basis, there will be little to no car accidents where people have died either in the vehicle or on the sidewalks DUI, drinking and driving, will not be an pestering issue anymore.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the idea of banning cars is magnificant. There will be less pollution, less traffic jams, more businesses and shops and restauraunts opening to suit our needs, and just overall great for the environment. We can all join up together as a union to save our Earth, the Ozone Layer from allowing harmful objects from outer space into our atmosphere, and induce more activity amongst each other. We will all be happier and less irritated without the ruckus of cars and checkup like oil leaks, motor mishaps. Think of this new world, it could happen with one voice.Dear Senator, I feel that we should change using the Electoral college. The popular vote is much more effective. Using the popular vote to decide who becomes president would show who the citizens of the united states want. The popular vote shows what each state has voted for, using the Electoral college takes the right away for the people being able to vote for the president that they favor. Instead of using what the people voted for they come together to chose the candidate they predict would be the best and do the most for the country and that\\'s not fair. If voting is important to this country then congress should understand that when the poeple vote for something everyone wants it to be their decisions that makes one of the two candidates become president not who the Electoral college believes would be best. If we could overcome the debate between what process works better more people might vote.\\n\\nAlthough some citizens believe that the Electoral college is a good idea. I feel that if they compared not having the electoral college and only using the popular vote during voting periods they would feel they system is more efficient. One example is big states could make a tremendous impact on which candidate wins the election. These states have more people with more opinions that should be used during the time of the election for the president.\\n\\nSome of the problems with the Electoral college is not only do voters not vote for their president, Back in 1960 \" The Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Deomcratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy\". \"In that same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please\" That is not what we are promised as a country. It states that the electoral college is suppose to cast a vote on what their state wants and what their state has chosen. That year the right to do so was taken away. Voting is a serious matter. Popular vote would clearifiy what each states popular favor is, who they want, and which candidate their vote was to be casted for.\\n\\nI hope with all the information that I have just provided you with above will help to show you that the popular vote isn\\'t only what most people want it\\'s also the better choice.Wouldnt it be great to hear that Just by citizens limiting car usage they are kind of making the world a better place? Instead of driving from place to place, they at the park, or taking a nice walk around town, or maybe even having a little fun ice skating. Its exciting to hear by just walking anywhere instead of taking a car or a motor vehicle, you are making the environment better. Also who doesn\\'t love less traffic in the streets? Limiting car usage has so many advantages, you maybe just have to get out of your car to see it. Imagine walking down the street and hearing the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional sound of a distant motor.\\n\\nIn Vauban Germany, most streets are completely car free. Heidrun Walter said \"when i had a car i was always tense. Im much happier this way.\" Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe, and fifty percent in some car intensive areas in the Untied States. pollution is a huge problem, not only for us but for the environment. Just by limiting cars,you can reduce gas emissions. In the the passage it says that in the untied states, the environmental protection agency is promoting \"car reduced\" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.\\n\\nParis enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Almost four thousand drivers were fined, and they also had their cars impounded due to some of their reactions to the fine. large traffic went down in the capital of france after five days of intensifying smog. In the passage it says that cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. They blamed diesel fuel because france has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. All these car fumes and bad pollution can cause many dangers and car usage has a big part in this problem. By limiting car usage, the smog in paris cleared enough on monday for the ruling french party to rescined the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday.\\n\\nIn another place, Bogota Colombia, it was the third straight year cars have been banned with only busses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of seven million. They did this so they can reduce smog. The people who didnt follow the rules while this day was in progress, they faced twenty five dollor fines. this day can do good for many people and can give you many opportunitys that you havent got to do before. In the passage a businessman named carlos arturo plaza said \"it\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" he said that while riding a two seat bicycle with his wife. the usage of cars is not always need, having a little fun wont hurt, taking a walk, going to the park is always a good thing. Even if it rains, that wont stop the people from participating in this day.\\n\\nCar usage isnt the worst thing in the world but there are many advantages when you dont use them. pollution decreases, as well as smog. you have a day to enjoy the outside world. while you do that think of the gas emmisons you arent putting in the environment. People dont really notice it but pollution has a big effect to global warming. Just by limiting your car usage, you can be doing a favor not only to you but the environment and the world.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This has been observed in various countries around the world, as highlighted in the passages provided. By implementing measures to reduce car dependency, communities can achieve numerous benefits such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, increased accessibility to public transportation, and enhanced quality of life.\\n\\nOne of the greatest advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, both in Europe and the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, communities can make strides in combating climate change and improving the overall health of the environment.\\n\\nIn addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also lead to improved air quality. The passage about Paris enforcing a driving ban due to smog illustrates how car emissions can contribute to poor air quality. By restricting car usage, communities can mitigate the impact of air pollution and create a healthier living environment for their residents.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can encourage the development of more compact and accessible communities. As described in the passage about Vauban, Germany, smart planning can involve placing stores within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation over private cars. This approach not only reduces the need for car usage but also fosters a sense of community and promotes a healthier lifestyle.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for increased accessibility to public transportation. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, highlights how a car-free day can encourage alternative forms of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit. By promoting these modes of transportation, communities can reduce congestion on the roads and make public transportation a more viable and convenient option for residents.\\n\\nFinally, limiting car usage can contribute to an overall improved quality of life. The passage about Vauban, Germany, emphasizes how residents who have given up their cars feel happier and less stressed. This is supported by the passage about the decline in car ownership in the United States, which suggests that Americans are finding alternative ways to meet their transportation needs. By reducing car dependency, individuals can experience a greater sense of freedom and flexibility in their daily lives.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. It can lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, increased accessibility to public transportation, and an overall improved quality of life. By adopting measures to reduce car dependency, communities can contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future.Title: The Benefits of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nIntroduction:\\nThe increasing awareness of the detrimental effects of car usage on the environment has led to a change in mindset among citizens and policymakers. Several instances around the world have demonstrated the advantages of limiting car usage. This essay will explore the benefits of reducing the dependency on cars, such as improving air quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting healthier lifestyles, and enhancing community connectivity.\\n\\nBody:\\n\\n1. Improved Air Quality and Reduced Emissions:\\na. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions.\\nb. In Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12% of these emissions.\\nc. In some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number reaches up to 50%.\\nd. Limiting car usage can significantly decrease emissions and improve air quality.\\ne. Examples like Paris implementing driving bans during smog episodes highlight the effectiveness of reducing car usage in combating pollution.\\nf. By adopting car-reduced communities, emissions can be reduced, benefiting both the environment and public health.\\n\\n2. Healthier Lifestyles:\\na. Limiting car usage encourages alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit.\\nb. Active modes of transportation contribute to better physical health.\\nc. In Vauban, Germany, where car ownership is limited, the majority of residents do not own cars and report being happier and less stressed.\\nd. Pedestrian-friendly environments and the availability of public transportation in car-reduced communities promote physical activity and healthier lifestyles.\\n\\n3. Enhanced Community Connectivity:\\na. Car-reduced communities are designed with compact layouts and accessible public transportation.\\nb. This planning approach encourages residents to walk or bike to nearby amenities, reducing the need for long-distance driving.\\nc. Placed a walk away from residential areas, stores and services promote community interaction and reduce reliance on cars for daily needs.\\nd. The success of car-free day initiatives, such as those in Bogota, Colombia, demonstrates the viability of alternative modes of transportation and the potential for enhanced community cohesion.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various cities and communities around the world. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, promotion of healthier lifestyles, and enhanced community connectivity all contribute to a more sustainable future. As governments and citizens embrace this shift towards car-reduced communities, we can look forward to a cleaner and healthier environment for ourselves and future generations.Everyday a great many people drive their cars to commute to work, run errands, and sometimes drive their cars for career related purposes. Little do they know that the greenhousee gas emissions that their automobiles create are damaging the environment and creating large amounts of pollution in metropolitan areas. To help reduce the gas emmisions caused by automobiles many countries around the world have created programs and communities that are designed to lessen the amount of car usage in the areas that they are employed in. In doing so they have reduced the amount of greenhousee gasses in Earth\\'s atmosphere along with producing many other benefits.\\n\\nOf all the advantages of limited car usage the most attractive one would definetely have to be reduced pollution and greenhousee gas emissions. Not only will people save money on fuel in communities that forbid the usage of cars but they will save the planet as well. According to the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.\" The information shows that a large amount of gas emissions can be produced by automobiles. Assume that there were a lot of cities that had incredibly low rates of car usage. If those city\\'s greenhouse gas emission levels were compared to those of an average car filled city then it would be logical that the carfree city produced less greenhousee gasses.\\n\\nAnother positive change that has the ability to happen in cities and communities that limit their car usage is that municipal development can occur. When people start to use cars less and less then businesses would most likely move to more accessible locations which in turn may give the businesses more customers. Due to the increased business in certain stores, stores from different companies will likely move in to areas in and around the one the other businesses reside in to drum up their sales as well. The article \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" supports my statement in the with the sentence, \"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" The sentence shows the correlation between lessening car usage and municipal development.\\n\\nIn the end, the advantages of limiting car usage are as bountiful as fish in the ocean. From lessening the amount of pollution in cities to aiding the development of cities, limiting car usage can do great things.Dear Senator, If one could sum up the definition of the Electoral College in a few words, those words would be unessasary and room for error. The Electoral College was established by our fore fathers in the constitution. Paragraph one in What is the Electoral College by the Office of the Federal Register states \"A compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\" It is more than possible that a change in our voting system could better america in all kinds of ways.\\n\\nI believe that the electoral College takes away the peoples opinion in a way just discreet enough to still call it a democracy. The people still vote and determine the overall outcome of the election, But with an electoral college, there is more then enough room for error. One argument against the Electoral College is in the very purpose of the system. The people votes go to an electors slate that share the same view as you, then they vote for a candidate. This is opposed to the peoples vote going directly to the candidate. This method of voting is if not purposeless then problematic. Electors can betrey your trust and vote for the opposite candidate. A statement from bradford Plumers\\' The Indefensible Electoral College says \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.\" In America our society is based off of freedom and the electoral college is not promoting it. Please keep in mind that the legislature is nearly completly responsable for choosing our electors. At any election they could defy the peoples choice. excerpt from The Indefensible Electoral states \"back in 1960, segregationists in the louisiana legislature neary succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.\" Electors have occasionally been know for simply refusing to vote for their party\\'s candidate. If this is freedom to vote then there undoubtingly needs to be a change in the near future.\\n\\ncandles like the one thay occurred in 1960 rarely happen, but whos to say that it could not happen in the future. Our presidential election is practically based off of trust in our government. The Electoral college does recognize voters from each region of the county but due to the way the system is set up, it does a poor job interpreting the votes of the people.\\n\\nA quote from In Defence of the Electoral College by Richard A. Posner states \"It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popluar vote\" This happened as recently as the election of 2000 Then ask yourself what would really be the harm of ignoring the Electoral College. It only would make the outcome clearer.\\n\\nThe American elections differ from most countrys in the way that we are a democracy. we the people can vote. we the people have individual voices that are the composition of the country. The elector college does not oppose this. But rather is opening the doors for corruption. Taking away the Electoral College and replacing it with popular vote, is simply clarifying the peoples decisions, and the peoples decisions is nothing less then America itself.Living in a world covered in dark,suffocating smog is not the first thing that comes to mind when we imagine an ideal environment. The smog that hangs over our head at this very moment is an example of what humanity has contributed to this worlds health,disease. If we call this our home then we should find a suitable solution to provide a more stable condition of the Earth\\'s wellbeing. Limiting car use is a universal solution in which countries across the globe are taking part of. It has been shown on numerous occasions that limiting car usage, or even going to the extreme of banning them, has created a stress free atmosphere, a healthier world, and has lead to economic growth.\\n\\nThe \"smart planning\" trend that has grown in popularity in the United States and Europe is a stepping stone to how we plan to stop the exaggerated use of cars. In Vauban, Germany with their 5,500 residents have made the ultimate sacrifice and have completly given up cars, besides the 40,000 parking spot you wish to obtain along with your house. A residence has remarked on how she was \"...happier this way than when she had a car,\"that when she had a car she was \"always tense,\" not the exact response most people believe, yet eliminating that rushed environment has increased the supporters of anticars. businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza from Bogota, Columbia which has implemented an effective program that has banned the use of cars on certain days looks at this event as a \"good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" and as it has shown he seems to be right on that.\\n\\n12% of the atmospher over Europe is made of of greenhouse gases while in a America, where car use is more frequent, in certain congested spots could be as high as 51%. Cars make an incredible barrier as to what we can achieve in environment conservation. On a Monday in Paris the city of lights the use of cars was banned by the government for the fog was at to of a horrendous state they needed to \"clear the air of a global city.\" Even though on average the plague that is infesting the atmospher is approximately 147 micrograms of particulate matterPM per square meter, while in Brussels it is 114PM and in London 79.7, if this is what it is on average imagine how much worse it must\\'ve been to banish the use of cars to clear the air. Even though it seems to be quite a scarafice, as we see in Paris 4,000 people were fined for driving on that Monday and 27 of them had their cars impounded purely based on their reaction, we see a trend of the decresing intrest of buying and using cars anyway and after a point in time we see a posotive result in the long run. As Drexel University sociology professor puts it \"...we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift,\" as in relation to America one of the leaders in car production and passion. Preventing the use of cars will substantially help the environment, just that one day of a driving ban on Paris was able to let the smog clear up enought to allow driving the next day, I guess you can see those lights a little brighter now.\\n\\nPart of the \"smart planning\" trend we are able to recognize is a need to aid in the effort to save our home. The fact it promotes healthy living and an increase in businesses in suburbs making tsuburbs more in touch with consumers needs as seen in Botoga where \"parks and sports centers have bloomed,\" and ,\"new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up,\" it has morphed stressed societies into happier ones, and the potential to make for a better world is something undenyably needed in society today, a change to help us all.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n[Date]\\n\\nThe Honorable [Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my position on the question of whether to keep the Electoral College or switch to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. After reviewing the information from various texts, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained. While there are arguments to be made for a popular vote system, the Electoral College provides several important benefits that outweigh the potential drawbacks.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate\\'s share of the electoral votes usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that a dispute over the outcome of an election is less likely compared to a direct popular vote system. The winner-takes-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states also creates landslide victories, reducing the possibility of a tied national electoral vote. This certainty of outcome helps maintain stability and avoids prolonged disputes and uncertainty following elections.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Because no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates must appeal to voters across different states and regions. This requirement ensures that the president has broader support and considers the interests of different regions of the country. Without the Electoral College, candidates with strong regional appeal could win the popular vote by focusing solely on their strongholds, potentially leaving other regions feeling disenfranchised and ignored.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the Electoral College is that it gives greater attention to swing states. In a winner-takes-all system, candidates concentrate their campaign efforts on toss-up states, where the outcome is uncertain. This focus ensures that voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, leading to a more informed and thoughtful electorate. By giving greater weight to the concerns and interests of these swing states, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful voters have a significant say in the election.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political influence of large states. While the Senate already provides some degree of balance between large and small states, the Electoral College further ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to the concerns of larger states. In the Electoral College system, winning a small state by a slight margin may provide fewer electoral votes compared to winning a large state by the same margin. This motivates candidates to consider the needs and issues of larger states in their campaigns.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College avoids the issue of run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, run-off elections can complicate the election process. The Electoral College guarantees a clear winner by rarely allowing a candidate to win the electoral vote without securing a majority of the popular vote. This avoids the need for further elections and ensures a smoother transition of power.\\n\\nWhile it is true that the Electoral College may discourage some voters in non-competitive states from participating, the overall voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. This suggests that voters are motivated to express their political preferences, regardless of their state\\'s electoral outcome. Additionally, efforts can be made to promote engagement and increase voter turnout in all states, regardless of their electoral competitiveness.\\n\\nIn conclusion, despite the criticism that the Electoral College has received, it provides crucial benefits that should not be overlooked. From ensuring certainty of outcome to promoting trans-regional appeal and preventing run-off elections, the Electoral College serves an important role in our democracy. While there may be merits to the arguments in favor of a popular vote system, the advantages of the Electoral College outweigh the potential drawbacks. Therefore, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College.\\n\\nThank you for considering my viewpoint on this important issue. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Dear Senator, I am not alone when I say that I\\'m not in favor of keeping the Electoral College. According to the gallop poll taken in 2000, over 60% of voters prefer a direct election, but Congress does nothing to change that. Keeping the Electoral college is unfair to the people of the United States. We should not keep the electoral College because, when Americans are voting, they are not voting for their president but for a slate of electors the legislature is responsible for picking our electors not the people and the process of a tie in the Electoral College is too unfair to the people.\\n\\nWhen Americans are voting for a new president, they want their opinion to count. The popular vote explains what the people wanted for president, but that\\'s not what the people are voting for. When we are voting for president, we are instead voting for a slate of electors they in turn vote for the president. Voters can\\'t control who the electors vote for, and this gives the a small say in voting for the president.\\n\\nIn the 2000 presidential race Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush, but Bush won the election due the amont of electoral votes over powering the popular votes. This completely goes against what the people want. The state legislatures are responsible for picking our slate electors these electors have the right to defy the will of the people. Electors have refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please.\\n\\nDuring a presidential election, one of the most worrying things to receive from an electoral vote is a tie. When there is a tie, the election is sent to the House of Representatives. Due to the fact that many voters vote one party for the president and another for Congress, the House\\'s selection will barely reflect the will of the people. Their votes can be the complete opposites of the people\\'s vote. You could help us bring an end to the Electoral College.From the small town of Cocoa, Florida, to the busy streets of Beijing, China, driving cars is a global phenomenon. It could be said that reducing the use of cars is beneficiary to the human population. Although, some believe that the negative effects of limiting automobile usage will surely outweigh the positive outcomes. The superior argument, however, is overall, less vehicle use.\\n\\nLimiting car use would be an improvement to society on a global scale. According to source 1, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This shows that the the excessive use of transportation harms the ozone layer. Even at 12 percent, the percentage will gradually increase and later will become an even more significant threat to Earth\\'s atmosphere. According to source 4, transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind powerplants. If the numbers were reduced, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This would cause less pollution and more breathable air in the long run. The world we share will become uninhabitable if we continue in these environmental patterns.\\n\\nFurthermore, there is more justification for the advantages of limiting car usage. According the source 2, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. This was due to the fact that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air five days before. The amount of time it took to air out smog that rivaled Beijing,China is an impressive factor of being fuel efficient. According the source 3, Bogota Columbia has a program where, for a day, you go around town carfree. It is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. This has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Not only does the environment become more habitable, but your physical health is improved as well.\\n\\nHowever, some would argue that limiting vehicle use is not the route to go. According to source 2, when the Paris driving ban was enforced, delivery companies complained of lost profit. This is not completely true since plugin cars, hybrids, and other earthfriendly cars were unaffected by the Parisian ban. Car companies will still be in business because of the use of green cars instead of fossil fuelpowered automobiles. According to source 4, demographic research has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. This may harm the next generation as they become more dependent on alternative methods of traveling. It does not mean, however, that they won\\'t have similar efficiency of speed and reliability with different transportations as they would now. The goverenment will have more money from public transportation to improve upon the community, and greener way. of traveling, like walking or bike riding, will create stronger immune systems and keep the majority of the population in healthy physical shape. The argument of the disadvantages of limiting car usage is somewhat counterproductive, as shown in this paragraph.\\n\\nCars, one of the less significant necessities of a well functioning society, will continue to be used. Children, teens, and adults alike will all be affected by the results of driving. We do require a method of convienient transportation for daily occurences, however, there is an extent over how much driving is sufficient to continue our everyday lives. Whatever an individual\\'s decision may be, the amount of car usage will determine the living conditions on Earth for generations to come.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: Supporting the Electoral College to Preserve the Integrity of Presidential Elections\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the United States presidential elections, as opposed to replacing it with a popular vote system. Although there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue, I believe that the Electoral College provides greater certainty of outcome, ensures that candidates have broad national appeal, promotes engagement in swing states, restores balance for large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College guarantees a definitive outcome in presidential elections. Unlike a popular vote system, where disputes over the counting and legitimacy of individual votes can initiate prolonged legal battles, the Electoral College offers a more succinct process that allows for a resolution to be reached. This was evident in the close 2000 election, which would have been further complicated and potentially led to a constitutional crisis if it were solely determined by the popular vote. The Electoral College system avoids such uncertainties and provides more stability in the democratic process.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College fosters the need for presidential candidates to have widespread appeal across different regions. A candidate must secure support from multiple states to accumulate the required electoral votes, promoting campaigns that focus on the concerns of various communities across the country. This prevents candidates from solely targeting populous states or demographic strongholds, which would result in regional favoritism and disregard the interests of citizens in other areas. By maintaining the Electoral College, we ensure that every state and its residents receive attention and representation throughout the campaign process.\\n\\nIn addition, the Electoral College encourages candidates to engage with and address the concerns of swing states. These states, which have a history of voting for different parties in different elections, hold significant influence in determining the outcome of the presidential race. By concentrating campaign efforts in swing states, candidates are incentivized to tailor their platforms and policies to the needs and preferences of these diverse electorates. This increases voter engagement and allows for a more informed decision-making process by citizens who are most likely to directly impact the election\\'s outcome.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College restores balance for large states. Due to the unequal distribution of electoral votes across states, candidates are motivated to campaign in highly populated regions, even if those states are not consistently aligned with their party affiliation. This ensures that densely populated states, such as California and Texas, do not monopolize political attention, allowing smaller states to have a voice and participate actively in the presidential elections. The Electoral College system accounts for the diverse interests of states and ensures that all citizens have a fair opportunity to influence the election outcome.\\n\\nFinally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate and prolong the presidential election process. By requiring a candidate to secure an absolute majority of electoral votes, the system avoids the need for additional rounds of voting when no candidate receives a majority in the popular vote. This efficiency saves time and resources and ensures the election process proceeds smoothly.\\n\\nWhile some argue that the Electoral College discourages potential voters in solidly partisan states, it is important to note that individual votes rarely determine presidential elections. The idea that a single vote may be the deciding factor is not a common expectation among voters. Despite this, the percentage of voter turnout remains consistently high in presidential elections, indicating that people participate in the electoral process to express their political preferences rather than to influence the outcome.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College provides a time-tested framework that maintains the integrity of presidential elections. Its retention ensures that outcomes are not subject to prolonged disputes, candidates possess national appeal, swing states receive adequate attention, large states are not disproportionately favored, and run-off elections are avoided. I encourage you to consider these points when evaluating potential changes to the election process and to support the continuation of the Electoral College.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]We run our elections by a process called Electoral College. This process consists of tje selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The Electoral College consists or 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.\\n\\nThere also is another process which is the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. We could change to popular vote but why would we change how we run the election if this is how we have been doing it for years. Also there are many other reasons why we should keep the Electoral College. Such as certainty of outcome, everyone\\'s president, swing states, Big states,and also avoid runoff elections.\\n\\nA dispute over the outcome of an electoral Collge vote is possible but it\\'s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidates share of the electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. Also the electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\\n\\nThe Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution. The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay more attentionto the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters.\\n\\nIt can be argued that the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state. I believe that we should not change our electorial process to popular vote and i think we should stick with the process we have now Elecoral College. I listed my resonas why but the main reason is that everyone is so used to the Electoral College process because we have been doing it for years so to change it, it might confuse everyone and actual make the elections even more difficult and it might end up messing up our election and cause an unfair vote.Ever wondered how the streets of a very populated city would look like? For example, Miami. At night Miami is full buildings that stand out in color, and on the highways you can see a whole road full of lights, the thing with these lights is that they are cars, even though they are helpful by getting us from point A to point B, they are the second highest source of pollution in the United States, that is after power plants. The only thing a city like Miami is missing at night is a sky full of bright stars, which that can be done by people not driving to everywhere they go, even if it is one or two blocks away. This whole \"carfree\" thing is become more and more popular all over the world.\\n\\nIn Vauban, Germany a small town, home to 5,500 people have decided to go carfree. \"As a result, 70 percent of vaughn\\'s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here\" Source 1. 70 percent of the the people is a lot, these streets are completly carfree except in the main thoroughfare and on the edge of the community, if this were to happen to a larger city the nights would be beautiful, and so will the days because you have all the car noise out and instead you have people talking and kids running all around the streets. \"passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States\" source 1. Miami is a carintensive area, I know this from personal experience, there is always traffic during the day. I\\'ve been to other places in Florida, not that far from Miami, in Palm Beach at night the amount of starts you see at nights is beautiful and it\\'s something new to see other than in Miami you see 2 to 3 stars. My point here isn\\'t stars, it\\'s how much better the world can be if we all do what this small town in Germany is doing.\\n\\nParis, France. The city of lights home to millions of residents and a landmark for millions of tourists, one would think this city couldn\\'t run without cars, but they made it happen. Paris wanted to clean all the air polution in their city, \"On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31\" Source 2. Even though some didn\\'t listen and about 4,000 drivers were fined, that is still very little compared to the entire population of Paris. \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog\" Source 2. Can you believe that? Traffic was down by 60 perfect in the city of lights, if it can happen there it can happen all around the world, little by little bu we\\'ll get it. Public transportation was free of charge in the city while this carfree thing was going on. One week later the smog had cleared out enough for the ruiling French party to rescind the ban.\\n\\n\"BOGOTA, Colombia In a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams\" Source 3. Yes, the city of Bogota in Colombia had its one carfree day, in Bogota called \"Day Without Cars\", this was the third year actually, on this \"carfree\" day cars are banned and only buses and taxis are permitted for the day. Bogota was not the only Colombian city to participate in this event, other Colombian cities like Cali and Valledupr, participated in this event for the first time. I find it funny and ironic because my sister has a friend who is Colombian and she owns a bicycle and she goes everywhere in that bicycle, and she refuses to get a car. Bogota is a very known city and just like I said before, if they can do it then the whole world can it. This day should be world wide and should be done at leats twice a year. Events like this will also get people motivated to start walking morre often. \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\" Source 3. If you\\'ve ever been to Miami, you know the huge amount of building there are here and I think there are about 3 or 4 being built at I type, how about we stop there and make Miami and healthier and more environmentally friendly place.\\n\\nIn the United States, research shows \"A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009\" Source 4. This meaning that adolescents aren\\'t as intresting and driving as they were before, yeah I see how driving can be better but most kids here take the bus, they aren\\'t even driven by their parents anymore. I find that this is a good thing because, one can ask themselves, I can\\'t make a difference, but if thousands of people ask themselves that, then yes a difference can be made. In 2005 the miles driven by Americans peaked, and then steadily went dropping, in April, 2013 they found out that the miles in car was the same as it was in 1995. Not driving everywhere you go and actually walking there is a good thing because you can make new friends, and health wise it is also good because, instead of walking around your block for an hour, you can walk to someones house or to the store. There are several carpooling apps on the internet nowadays, if your friends can\\'t pick you up, for just a push of a button you can have someone come pick you up to where ever you are and drop you off where you need to go to, for a low price. \"Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by\" Source 4. This means that people aren\\'t as interest in driving anymore, which means we are slowly getting near the time where we\\'ll see more stars in the sky in carintensive areas.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State ZIP Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State ZIP Code]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to prioritize its continuation in our presidential elections. While some argue in favor of replacing it with a direct popular vote, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic system that preserves fairness, regional representation, and the certainty of outcome.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in presidential elections. This is vital to maintaining the stability and integrity of our democratic process. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote while only obtaining 51.3 percent of the popular vote. This demonstrates that the Electoral College prevents close elections from being subject to endless recounts and potential disputes over the popular vote. Furthermore, due to the winner-takes-all allocation of electoral votes, a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory, reducing the likelihood of a tie in the overall electoral vote total.\\n\\nAnother important aspect of the Electoral College is that it ensures that every region of our diverse nation has a say in the selection of the President. By requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College fosters the election of candidates who are truly representative of the entire country. It prevents candidates with only regional popularity from neglecting the interests and concerns of other regions. By having each state\\'s electors vote for the candidate who won the popular vote in that state, the Electoral College ensures a fair representation of regional preferences.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states, where the outcome is uncertain and every vote matters. In a direct popular vote system, candidates would have no incentive to campaign in states they know they have no chance of winning, which would result in the neglect and disregard of certain states and their issues. This would leave many voters feeling disenfranchised and their interests ignored. By having a system that rewards candidates for engaging with swing states, the Electoral College guarantees that campaigns are conducted across a wide range of states, allowing for a more comprehensive representation of the nation\\'s opinions and concerns.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College balances the influence of large states against small states, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate. In a presidential campaign, large states receive more attention than small states due to their higher number of electoral votes. This ensures that candidates must consider the concerns and perspectives of Americans living in both large and small states. Without the Electoral College, candidates would likely focus exclusively on heavily populated areas, ignoring the needs and interests of rural and less populous areas.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College helps prevent the need for run-off elections. By designating a clear winner based on the majority of electoral votes, it avoids potential complications and delays that would arise from run-off elections. This ensures a smooth transition of power and guarantees that the president-elect has a legitimate mandate to govern.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College plays a vital role in our democratic system. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes regional representation, encourages candidates to engage with swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is a fair and effective method for electing our president and should be retained to preserve the integrity and stability of our electoral process.\\n\\nThank you for considering my viewpoint. I implore you to keep the Electoral College intact and resist calls for a direct popular vote. I trust that you will make decisions that uphold the principles of our constitution and serve the best interests of our great nation.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name][Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my views on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After considering the information from multiple sources, including \"What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register and \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept as the method for selecting the President.\\n\\nFirstly, one of the key reasons for retaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,\" the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College often exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of the Electoral College vote are less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. Furthermore, the winner-take-all system in most states creates a landslide victory for the winning candidate, even with a slight plurality. This ensures a clear and decisive outcome for the presidency.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of everyone\\'s President. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College requires a candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from winning the presidency. This is important because it ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions and avoids a situation where certain regions feel disenfranchised.\\n\\nThirdly, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. Plumer highlights in his article that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to appeal to voters in toss-up states. These voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make thoughtful decisions, thereby ensuring that the most engaged and informed voters play a significant role in deciding the election.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College balances the weight of large and small states. Judge Posner argues that the Electoral College restores some of the political balance lost by large states due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This means that presidential candidates are more likely to pay attention to large states during their campaigns, as the number of electoral votes a large state offers is significant. This ensures that issues and concerns of states with larger populations are not overshadowed by smaller states.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College produces a clear winner, even if no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This eliminates the need for complicated run-off elections that can prolong the election process and further divide the nation.\\n\\nWhile it can be argued that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters who feel their votes will have no effect, the fact remains that the Electoral College method continues to encourage voter participation. As Plumer mentions, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, indicating that people vote to express their political preference rather than expecting their single vote to decide the election.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College should be maintained as the method for electing the President of the United States. The certainty of outcome, the representation of all regions, the focus on swing states, the balance between large and small states, and the avoidance of run-off elections are all valid reasons to support the Electoral College system. While some argue for direct popular vote, the Electoral College effectively achieves the goals of fairness, representation, and avoiding potential election crises.\\n\\nThank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College in the best interest of our democracy.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]The people have a right to say what they want to happen in their community, state, and even as far as the country they live in. They should be able to decide whether they want a park built in their city or whether they want a specific up and coming President. Yes, popular vote at the moment seems favorable for the people, but it does not mean that the people don\\'t vote in the the process of the Electoral College. They truly do vote for their president, just not in a way that they would like. Nonetheless, they do. That being said, the system of election should be kept to the Electoral College.\\n\\nTo begin with, the Electoral College, in a sense, is not democratic, as seen in modern times but it does not mean that it is not equal. Yes, they are voting for an elector in their state, trusting that they would vote for their chosen candidate. \"But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed...,\" as shown by Richard A. Posner in \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\". This means that, even though the people are voting for an elector to pass on their message, they are still voting to make sure that the president they want to take the seat will get it. The electors so rarely betray the trust of the voters it has happened one time in 2000, but again that was the first time since 1888. The most thoughtful voters will listen closely to the campaign, then choose which president they feel is fit. Which again, leads to the voters deciding, in the end. Furthermore, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states making it equal amongst those that have more population. For the most part, the Electoral College is equal.\\n\\nHowever, others can argue against the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote. \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always,\" said Bradford Plumer in \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong.\" That being said, sure they can\\'t control that but the elector rarely betrays the trust of the voters, only happening twice in recorded history. The Electoral College is still less likely to cause a problem than popular vote would. If popular vote were to play in hand as a system of choosing the president, then things outside of even politics such as, riots, would get out of hand. \"...in the Constitution as comprimise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,\"as said by the Office of the Federal Register in \"What Is the Electoral College?\" Either way, voters do get popular vote, and vote for their elector to vote for their chosen President. It is a balanced idea of both a government and citizen based vote for the leader of the country.\\n\\nOverall, the Electoral College by far is a balanced system than popular vote is. It is fair, in the sense, that everybody gets a vote and in total, their votes go to what they think is best for their country. Which in turn, does allow for them to decide.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage can have many advantages for both individuals and communities. The passages provided offer several examples of places where car usage has been limited, and these examples demonstrate the potential benefits of such a change.\\n\\nOne advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. By using cars less frequently or not at all, these emissions can be greatly reduced, leading to a cleaner and healthier environment.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. In the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited and streets are car-free, residents experience less traffic and noise. This creates a more peaceful and relaxing atmosphere, allowing residents to enjoy the natural surroundings and engage in activities like walking and biking. Similarly, in Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to reduce smog and congestion. As a result, congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can also lead to healthier and more active lifestyles. In Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, residents rely on alternative modes of transportation like walking and biking. This promotes physical activity and reduces sedentary behavior, which can have various health benefits. Additionally, in Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. During this day, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work, leaving the streets free of traffic jams. This encourages individuals to engage in physical activity and reduces the reliance on cars for daily transportation.\\n\\nFinally, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and efficient use of space. In Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance, reducing the need for larger parking lots and malls located along distant highways. This compact and accessible layout encourages walking and reduces the need for excessive space dedicated to parking. Similarly, in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting \"car reduced\" communities. These communities prioritize public transportation and have less space dedicated to parking, making better use of limited urban space.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage can have many advantages, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing traffic congestion, promoting healthier lifestyles, and utilizing space more efficiently. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the positive impact that limiting car usage can have on individuals and communities. By implementing smart planning and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable environment for all.When you think about limiting car usage you might think \"Well how am I supposed to get there. Theres no way i\\'m able to get to my destination without a car.\" Yes, I\\'m pretty sure we all would\\'nt want to walk five thousand miles to visit a friend three hours away, but here me out. Doesnt a car make you all tired? Knowing you have to pay a bill every month, or getting gas four times a week. Just imagine a world where thats not a problem.\\n\\nIn Vauban Germany they are most of the time a car free zone. Owners of cars aren\\'t allowed to have cars in there garage or in the streets or wherever a car would normally be. They have to keep there cars in a space they buy at the edge of the community for 40,000 plus the paying for their homes. Now I wouldnt want to pay all this money to park my car. Most people in suburban homes sold their vehicles so that they could live there without a problem. Heidren Walter said,\" When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" She says as she\\'s walking down the street she can actual listen to the community of children playing and not be drown out from the loud motor in the car.\\n\\nNow, limiting car usage doesnt mean we all have to walk to our destinations. We could start using bicycles more often and actually get a benefit of working out. Sure it might make you all sweaty and gross. But make a plan to get up a little earlier and then wash up at wherever it is you are to be. And limiting cars doesnt mean every single one of us need to give up our cars. Instead we can find a friend who lives near to us or a fellow coworker and car pool. Instead of all two hundred employes lugging their cars on the road and getting stuck in torturous traffic. make a plan to get five people in a car and instead of two hundred cars on their way to work, there would only be about fourty cars going to the same place. That would clear up our roads and reduce traffic. In France Congestion was down sixty percent after reducing cars.\\n\\n\"Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Westurn Europe..\" ,according to Robert Duffer. People today are now worrying to much on their cars and how much it will cost them. Not worrying about jobs and insurance. The invention of the car was not to see who can get the most miles or whos car gets better horse power. It was about helping people get from A to B, and we can do just that.\\n\\nThere are many people out here who will think that limiting car use is a waste of time and like to keep things the same. But we can be the generation who changes that. If we could go down to one car a family and start car pooling with one another, or even start using bikes to go to places with our friends, we can help make the community a better place. One day just try. Try walking to the super market. Instead of making your mom drive you and your friends to the mall, try making a plan to all ride your bikes there. It doesnt hurt to try, so try to start.Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: A Step Towards Sustainable Living\\n\\nThe process of limiting car usage poses significant benefits not only individuals but also the world. Ranging from environmental preservation to improving lifestyle and quality of urban spaces, car-free or car-reduced communities paves the way for a sustainable future.\\n\\nPrimarily, the environmental advantages of limiting car usage are quite explicit. Less car usage translates to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, helping to slow down climate change (Rosenthal, 2009). As per EPA, passenger cars in some regions contribute up to 50% of the greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, 2009). On occasions where French authorities enforced partial driving bans due to extreme pollution, it resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion, clear evidence of how car usage contributes to pollution (Duffer, 2014). \\n\\nFurthermore, this reduction in car usage also has noticeable health benefits. Improvements in air quality lessen the risk of respiratory diseases caused by pollution (Duffer, 2014). The city of Bogota, throughout their annual car-free day, observed less smog and decreased stress levels among the city residents (Selsky, 2002). \\n\\nIn terms of urban city development, car-free neighborhoods are emerging as significantly more sustainable. Communities such as Vauban, Germany exhibit improved urban lifestyle due to lesser dependence on cars. The absence of cars resulted in quieter and cleaner streets conducive to walking and biking (Rosenthal, 2009). \\n\\nThe reduction in car usage also indirectly fosters a strong sense of community. With streets free from cars, residents can freely interact with their neighbours, children can safely play in the streets, and communal spaces can be more efficiently utilized (Rosenthal, 2009).\\n\\nMoreover, limiting car usage encourages the use of public transportation and biking, providing an opportunity for daily exercise and reducing the costs associated with vehicle ownership and maintenance.\\n\\nHowever, this transformation does not solely depend on individual choices, but requires collective effort. Governments and urban developers must prioritize public transportation, develop biking infrastructure, and provide incentives and legislation to foster car-reduced or car-free lifestyles (Rosenthal, 2009; Duffer, 2014).\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages that potentially enrich our quality of life and safeguard our environment. As the cases of Vauban, Paris and Bogota illustrated, a shift away from car culture leads to more sustainable, healthier, and community-friendly urban living. To further this cause, it would require a consolidated approach involving adjustments in lifestyle, changes in urban planning, and strong supportive legal frameworks.arguments on whether the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States are occurring today. Each favor has its advantages and disadvantages, but we should favor in keeping the Electoral College. This is because less disputes are likely to happen and not voting will not effect the election.\\n\\nOn the other hand, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States has some advantages. In \"Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\", author Bradford Plumer claims \"the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" because \"candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.\" This means that the candidates focus on the \"tight races of the swing states.\" To continue, Plumer also argues that changing to election by popular vote makes every vote counthowever, changing to election by popular vote will cause many disputes and it is not the right way to keep everyone satisfied with voting for a new president. Keeping the Electoral College is more realistic.\\n\\nTo begin, the Electoral College is fair to the states, leaving fewer disputes. In \"Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\", author Richard A. Posner explains that the Electoral College \"restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" The Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates as opposed to a smaller state. Posner continues the idea with \"the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\" To break it down, voters who pay close attention to the campaign will be the most thoughtful voters and they will receive the most attention from the candidates. This reduces the amount of disputes because the presidential candidates will decide on who to give the most attention to.\\n\\nIn addition, the Electoral College method does not get affected by the ones who chose not to vote. In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\", author Richard A. Posner states that \"knowing the voters vote has no effect gives them less incentitive to pay attention to the campaign.\" But, \"voters in presidential electons are people who want to express political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide and election.\" This means thatchanging everyone to a single vote will have no effect, too because people will not put thought into who to vote, but they will just vote for whoever.\\n\\nTo conclude, the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College rather than changing to election be popular vote for the president of the United States because less disputes will occur and not participating will not be effective.Some people like to drive while others don\\'t and some countries are making bans or just limiting the usage of cars. This can have more advantages than disadvantages.\\n\\nWhen people drive cars they let out pollution into the air which harms the atmosphere. The advantages to this is that if people don\\'t drive that much anymore the pollution can be stopped at a certain point and cause no harm anymore of course the air might still be polluted but with a less perentage. People would definitely use money on something else thtne to try and get the new car or just use it on gas. There are alternatives to limit the use of cars.\\n\\nsociologists believe if this continues with people limiting car transportation that \"it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emission, just behind power plants.\" so if we all got to think about it we are basically doing a favor to ourselves by helping the planet by limiting the use of cars.\\n\\nAnother advantage that this idea might have is that the people in the community could stop spending more money due to cuts in the job. They waste money on gas on new cars, etc. When really you could be doing something better with that money.\\n\\nMost poeple dont even really need cars they use them for the heck of it. Teenagers use it just to go around with friends or go to work but really they could limit that use and find another way of transportation. This isn\\'t saying to just stop using your car but just finding a way to say that if you dont really need your car but just using it for fun then you could limit that use and instead of driving to places that are close to you just walk there.\\n\\nThe author of \"The End of Car Culture\" elisabeth Rosenthal even said that her own kids being 19 and 21 \"have not even bothered to get a driver\\'s license....\" they find other ways to get around she said \"they organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends\" as i said before there are alternatives to limiting the usage of cars and this could be one of them if you are with friends and all are going to the same palce then you ca just share one car so that not all of the cars are ut it can avoid traffic and cost less money to you also.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I say that there are alot of advantages to limiting the use of cars and we could most definitely make more.Last year in 2014, the earth had the warmest temperature in recorded history. Needless to say, this is due to greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide. One of the major reasons behind an increase in greenhouse gases is due to the use of cars and motorcycles, which release high amounts of carbon dioxide. It is to our benefit that we prevent any form of unnatural climate change on earth, and the most effective way to execute this is by living a more \"carfree\" life, especially here in the United States as it is our second most contributing factor of our increasing greenhouse gases. America could follow the path that many other countries and cities took.\\n\\nIn Vauban, Germany, cars have been banned unless one should decide to buy a permit in the form of a public garage. Most citizens take other means of transportation than cars. They walk, use bicycles, or public transportation. This has resulted in Vauban having a much cleaner environment and less stress as a result of no traffic. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\" confesses Heidrun Walkter. Building suburbs like Vauban would result in a lower production of air pollution and a much more stress free environment.\\n\\nBogota has a similar policy as Vauban, but only lasts one day of the year. However, that only serves the citizens to be more enthusiastic about the event. Most people were glad to help out in anyway to reduce the smog. Bogota has also inspired other cities to do the same. Cali and Valledupar also decided to encourage this ecofriendly day. A day might not be much out of three hundred and sixty four, but a small contribution from a large mass of people can make a huge change. Implementing this same policy in more cities and countries would result in a notable change in the amount of air pollution around that time of year.\\n\\nParis resently executed a policy to ban cars with oddnumbered plates on Tuesdays as a consequence from a heavy smog that was brewing for several days. Paris had a smog of higher concentration than London, having 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter while London only had 78.7. There were residents who were unhappy with the ban, but the benefits the city gained from it were outstanding. Traffic was down by 60 percent and and as a recompensation for those who could not use their cars, public transportation was free from Friday to Monday. Due to the dedication of the mayor and citizens, the smog cleared up enough for the ban to be lifted. Making this a something a whole nation can participate in would definately improve the annual greenhouse gas emmssions.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can have a posotive heavy impact on the world as a whole if more people were to follow the examples of these cities. The year of 2014 was known as the hottest year in recorded history, and it undoubtedly has to do with how much greenhouse gasses we emmited. If we could follow the example of those cities, we could see a great change by the end of the year 2015. This change could fix the climate problems we\\'re currently having, and create a healthier, happier world.Cars are great, you can get from one point to another in a short amount of time, but are they really necessary? After all we have public transportation, bicycles, and our own two feet.\\n\\nThe advantages of car usage can be picked up by other forms of transportation, and the environment can be saved at the same time. If car usage was limited the world and its people would be much better off. There would be less pollution, a drop in the number of people diagnosed with diabetes, less accidents, and over all a healthier planet and world population.\\n\\nThere would be less pollution because if car usage was limited then there would be less pollutants from the gas in cars going up into the air. Source 2 provides evidence of this, from \"...days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\"Duffer 10 to \"The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday.\" Additionally many people are content with not having a vehicle, or even a licence in some cases, as shown in Source 1, 3, and 4. In Source 1 Heidrun Walter explains her view on not having a car after previously owning one, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" Carlos Arturo Plaza in Source 3, shows his support unlimited car usage by saying how it helps the environment and the health of the people in reducing stress, \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" In Source 4 Elisabeth Rosenthal speaks of how her own children and Mr. Sivak\\'s son, all avoid using cars and Rosenthal\\'s children don\\'t even have licenses and they are 19 and 21 years old.\\n\\nThe health of the people in our world would improve and there would be less people diagnosed with diabetes because they would likely get more exercise. With limited car usage people would have to find other ways of transportation, which includes bike riding, skating, hiking, or public transportation. While using public transportation would not help to improve the health of the people, biking, skating, and hiking would, as some people do these things just for exercise. So if people were forced to do one of these alternative forms of transportation, they would be exercising and getting from point A to point B all in one shot.\\n\\nNot only would limited car usage help peoples health by making them be more active, but it would also help by providing cleaner air. Poluted air can cause health problems, especially in the lungs, if car usage was limited, then polution would go down, so people would be breathing fresher air that would cause less lung damage.\\n\\nThere would be less accidents because there would be less cars on the road. The majority of the vehicles on the road would likely be public transportation too, so the drivers may be more cautious than the average driver since they have the lives of many people in their hands.\\n\\nThe world would be a safer and healthier place is car usage was limited.Cars are usually in most peoples every day lives. We drive them to work, school and many other purposes. Cars have been around for over one hundred years but are people really ready to limit car usage? In a lot of cases around the whole entire world the answer is yes. Their are many reasons to own an automobile, however their is a lot of reasons not to own an automobile as well.\\n\\nA main topic now around the globe is the environment. Not all cars are going to kill the environment but if you put too many cars in one area it can weaken an environment, this is including cities. Cars can cause a substance called smog which is terrible for the environment or a local residence such as a city or town. As a matter of fact Paris as inforced a partial driving ban to clear the smog of its city. Beijing, China is probably one of smogs worst victims. It is known as one of the most polluted city in the entire world! Sadly, cars are a huge part of the creation of smog. Smog is horrifically bad for the environment for a huge reason, and that reason is not being able to breathe.\\n\\nCars take up a lot of space in towns and cities across the entire globe. These areas are packed with roads, that take up many space of the area. imagine what it would be like with no streets, turnpike, roads in general. If you did imagine a world without roads you would see nothing but fields, trees, wildlife of every sort. If not wildlife you would see uncrowned cities with buildings that are close and not so hard to get to. People are adopting this idea around the entire world. These cities are easy and very manageable to go through. The environment is unbelievably clean in these cities and make life in general less of a hastle. This may not be the way of the future but it is a great idea!\\n\\nEvery car has a bad side to them. Not on the car itself but what it can do to you. Cars make a lot of people angry. How do cars make people angry you might ask? Their is a thing in the car community called traffic. If you drive a car chances are you have been in traffic before. Traffic can cause anger which some people like to call road rage. Sadly a lot of people have lost their lives to road rage by getting into car accidents. Car accidents take the lives of many people in the world. A lot of things can take peoples lives but cars cause some of the most deaths in the world. It is not true that a world withot cars would be more safe but the fact is, cars can be a very dangerouse tool.\\n\\nPeople use cars almost everywhere in this world but the question still remains, are people ready to limit car usage? Many people have their opinions about car usage and we may never know the answer to this question. If you think about it we have only been driving cars for a little over one hundred years. Us humans have been living on this earth for thousands of years and have been driving cars for only a little over one hundred. Cars are being more produced now than ever and I think will stay progressing for the future years to come. In reality most people need a car to live their lives. The way things are looking like now, chances are needing a car to live a normal life is going to progress in the folowing years of the future.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to voice my support for the retention of the Electoral College system for the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College serves as a crucial constitutional safeguard that ensures fair and representative outcomes in our presidential elections.\\n\\nThe Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers in the Constitution, acts as a crucial compromise between direct election by popular vote and election by a vote in Congress. This system consists of 538 electors, who represent each state\\'s Congressional delegation. To be elected President, a candidate must secure a majority of at least 270 electoral votes.\\n\\nOne of the key arguments in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate\\'s share of the electoral votes surpasses their share of the popular vote. This prevents disputes over the popular vote, as witnessed in the 2000 election. Furthermore, the winner-take-all system in most states strengthens the legitimacy of the president, as it creates a decisive electoral victory rather than a fragmented outcome.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal and strategize their campaigns accordingly. No single region, such as the South or the Northeast, possesses enough electoral votes to elect a president. This means that candidates must focus on gaining support across the nation, avoiding a scenario where certain regions feel unrepresented or ignored by the president. By preventing candidates from solely catering to their regional bases, the Electoral College fosters a sense of national unity.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College promotes attention to swing states. In recent elections, we have witnessed candidates giving greater importance to states that remain undecided, or \"toss-up states.\" By doing so, they actively engage with voters in these states, stimulating their participation and ensuring that the most thoughtful and informed voters have a significant say in determining the outcome of the election. This system encourages candidates to genuinely understand and address the concerns of swing state constituents.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the Electoral College is its support for large states. While the Senate provides mal-apportionment of representation, the Electoral College counteracts this imbalance by giving larger states a relatively greater influence. This consideration ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to issues affecting millions of citizens in these states, rather than solely focusing on smaller states. In this way, the Electoral College endeavors to distribute influence and representation more equitably.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by invariably producing a clear winner. With this system in place, there is reduced pressure for repeated rounds of voting when no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote. This streamlines the election process, preventing unnecessary delays and complications.\\n\\nWhile critics argue against the Electoral College, claiming it is unfair and outdated, it is important to note that it has stood the test of time for over two centuries. The Electoral College ensures that the presidency represents the interests of a diverse nation and discourages the tyranny of the majority. The continued support of the majority of voters, as evidenced in various polls, demonstrates that the Electoral College enjoys widespread public approval.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College safeguards the integrity and representativeness of our presidential elections. Its benefits include the certainty of outcome, the representation of diverse regions, the promotion of swing states, the balanced influence of larger states, and the avoidance of run-off elections. I respectfully ask you, as my esteemed senator, to consider these factors before making any decisions regarding the future of the Electoral College. The preservation of this institution is vital for the stability and prosperity of our nation.\\n\\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will weigh the pros and cons carefully before deciding on such an important issue. I have faith in your commitment to serving our state and our country to the best of your ability.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Dear Senator of Florida, What is the point of people voting if they are not really getting a say in who they are really voting for? The Electoral College has a bigger say then the thousands of of people who vote. How can a group of peoples say mean more then thousands of people in the United States. Also, the \"WinnerTakeAll\" system does not help anymore then the Electoral college does. What is so special about the Electoral College that they get picked specially to make their vote count on who wins or loses the election?\\n\\nTheir has been many mishappens because of the Electoral College. For example, from an excerpt called \"The Idefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong\" says \"The single argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worst.\" This shows that the electoral college does do damage to the United States because they let a huge crisis happen during the elections. They could have let it get even worst because they allow it to and make it easy to make things worst in certain crisis.\\n\\nI feel like you should give the people more of a say because half of the people that vote probably don\\'t even know that they are not actually voting for the president. They probably vote thinking that they are voting for the president not for the electoral college to see who will end up on the board. The Electoral College is overall unfair to the voters. Voters pay to vote, to what pay the Electoral College to vote and make their say so important it is sad. The reason it is sad is because all kids want to do when their younger is vote because they feel like it symbolizes them growing up and like they get a real say in who the next president is or the senate anything just as longs as they get a say. But truthful their not getting a say in who will be the next senate, treasurer, or president their actually picking the board who will be picking for them.\\n\\nEven the People once wanted to abolish the Electoral College. These People were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO. Turned out their not the only ones according to the exerpt from \"The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong.\" is sates \"They\\'re not alone according to a gallop poll in 2000 taken shortly after Al Gore thanks the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" It also states that \"This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.\" This show how the elections are in a way screwed up because they already in a way know how many votes a certain person is going to get and how many votes the other person is going to get. They practicly alredy know who is going to win the election before the voting even begins because the board already has it all planned out.\\n\\nSo really thier is no need for the Electoral College because all they do is make the competion unfair for the other person going for the election. Also, because they have cause or been a part of problems and mishappens. In an article it mentions \"Perhaps moat worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, were staes delegation vote on president.\" Also, when you are voting for the VicePresident you are not actually voting the senat picks who the VicePresident is. The Electoral College is overall unfair to the voters and the people running in the election.Dear Senator, I know that you have many issues to think about and have a lot of decisions to make, but I think it the subject of the Electoral College is a very important subject for you to ponder. The Electoral College needs to be changed, we need to vote for the presidency with the popular vote. I believe that the Electoral college needs to be taken away because it\\'s not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College, the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate, and it is a very confusing process for people to understand.\\n\\nFirst, the Electoral College should be changed because it is not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College. The people ar voting for the president, but not really. They are actually voting for a slate of electors, who then choose what candidate there electoral votes should go to. The whole point of a democracy is to let the people of the country have a say in who is in charge, but with the Electoral College this is not happening. The people are saying who they want for president but if the slate of electors does not agree, then the votes go the other way. This was expressed in \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong\" by Bradford Plummer. In the passage he says, \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John kerry, you\\'d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes.\" In addition, the Electoral College should be abolished because the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate. The Legislature is technically responsible for picking electors and theywould very well pick electors that are all against a certain candidate. Everyone says the system is so strong but is it really? The fact that a group of people opposing one candidate could be the electors for that state and could totally changed the votes doesn\\'t make the system look so strong. Plummer adressed this situation in his passage, he stated, \"Back in 1960, segregationista in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors wiht new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. so that the popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.\" Finally, the Electoral college system needs to be taken away because it is very confusing. The whole system is just a jumble of different things. There are so many different steps and processes that tend to confuse the voters. When the voters get confused they often end up voting for the wrong candidate or making a mistake. If the voting system was just, the voters voted for who they pleased, then the votes were counted, then all the votes from states are added together, and then whoever had the most votes won, the whole thing would just be much easier. I belive that when the situation is as impportant as voting for our president, it should be as easy and flawless as possible. For example, when I was in seventh grade, I learned about the Electoral College in civics class. learing about the Electoral College was one of the hardest and most complicated thing I learned that year. How are people supossed to vote, if they have no idea how the system works?\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that the electoral college needs to be abolished becauseit\\'s not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College, the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate, and it is a very confusing process for people to understand.Millions of people use cars in their everyday lives whether its driving to work, school or even the supermarket. With the amount of people on the streets on a daily basis, its not surprising that there is a major traffic issue in Miami. Most people dont realise how big of an issue this truly is because in reality they just need to get to and from work. I\\'m here to inform you about the beneficial alternatives to driving everywhere you go.\\n\\nWhether going to work or driving your kids to soccer practice, a way of transportation is a must. Most people choose the \"easy\" way out and just hop in their brand new luxury cars. But what if I told you there is an easier way, a more efficient way? All around Miami, there are metro rail stations. These stations are clean, safe, and not to mention useful. There are busses, troll\\'s, and even metro movers that can take you all around the city. the trains, busses, troll\\'s and metro movers all run on a schedule. An easy way to limit your gas bill, pollution and time wasted in traffic is to simply set up a route to where you need to go and catch the appropriate mose of transportation.\\n\\nTime is always on peoples mind, whether you have enough time to go shopping for a new dress or maybe stop by grandmas house. all things require time. Everyday millions of Americans spend hours stuck in traffic due to rushhour. This means less time spent with family anymore time bonding with the annoying car horns constantly beeping. If you could switch to another mode of transportation you could cut time commuting in half. The Metro rail avoided all traffic regardless and if more people start thinking like this then the bus might soon be avoidingall traffic too. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says \"When i had a car i was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" Everyday she walks verdant streets listening to the delightful sound of people chatting and children playing, something she was unable to appreciate with her windows rolled up as she drove around town.\\n\\nSo many fuel consuming vehicles on the street on a daily basis can\\'t be too great for our environment, don\\'t you think? It isnt, all this pollution is causing a nasty smog all over the world, some places more than others. Paris tends to have more smog than Europe but not too long ago, Paris had 147 micrograms or particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels. This smog makes it difficult for dilivery companies to complete their jobs. This smog isnt good for us either just think about what you are breathing.I have an opinion that I know others will agree with extremely. By popular vote, we should change the election process to The People voting directly. According to my knowledge, the Electoral College isn\\'t fair to voters. I know that many people such as, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFCCIO agree with me on this. For instance, in the second passage on the first paragraph, it says that and much more. \"They\\'re not alone Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter... according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" Suggesting by what this statement says, a lot of people disagree with our system of election. We should be able to vote directly ourselves and not have electors do it for us. How do we know we can trust them? Yes, they\\'re a part of our government, but that doesn\\'t mean a thing.\\n\\nThe Electoral College was originally founded to be exactly what it is today a vote that is held in Congress that is made by popular vote by citizens. But it has changed more than you think. In article one in the 6th paragraph, it tells exactly how the Electoral College is run. \"The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in november. You help choose your state\\'s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate\\'s electors.\" This paragraph is saying that the person you vote for is basically supposed to be voted for by his electors. In the second article, what the author is saying is that even though this certain person will get popular vote, they won\\'t agree with it and they\\'ll go against the votors decisions. This isn\\'t the right thing, obviously. I\\'m sure that no one knows for a fact that\\'s true though. Even though, this is still a messed up way to vote. This country is about freedom and the right to do what we\\'d like, as long as it\\'s rational. This is not rational. We need to be able to vote independently.\\n\\nThere are many things wrong with this aspect of our government. Even though people don\\'t think much of it, we\\'re being treated unfairly. In the second article, in paragraph 2, Plumer the author makes a very good point. \"Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party\\'s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.\" This makes us realize that we don\\'t know who, for a fact, the electors are. It also shows that we don\\'t know who the electors will vote for. Usually, they would probably vote for the person that were made to vote for.\\n\\nNone of us know what goes on in the Electoral College. We don\\'t know if they vote for who we tell them to vote for. We don\\'t know if they practically cheat us from getting the president we want. In article one, paragraph 8, there is something that the governor does that maybe is supposed to reassure us. \"After the presidential election, your governor prepares a \"Cerificate of Ascertainment\" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors.\" This is just them saying who was all voted for and who all ran. It also says who the electors were. They give us this probably just to notify us but maybe it\\'s also an idea to make us think that Electoral College is proud to help us get who we want. As I have said through this whole letter, we deserve to directly vote for our President. This isn\\'t fair to us or the person we want elected.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[State Senator\\'s Name]\\n[State Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: In Support of the Electoral College\\n\\nDear [State Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides important benefits and should be preserved. I would like to present my arguments in favor of the Electoral College based on information from various sources, including \"What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register and \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Judge Richard A. Posner.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As Judge Posner points out, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that a dispute over the outcome is less likely than it would be under a popular vote system. Additionally, the winner-take-all method used by most states in allocating electoral votes creates a landslide victory for the candidate with even a slight plurality in that state. This reduces the likelihood of an electoral tie, ensuring a clear outcome in the presidential election.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of \"everyone\\'s President.\" By requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, it prevents candidates from focusing solely on certain regions and neglecting others. This ensures that the elected president represents and considers the interests of all regions of the country. As Judge Posner argues, without this requirement, a candidate with only regional appeal would be unlikely to be a successful president, and residents of other regions would feel disenfranchised.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states. This is beneficial because voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions, as they know they will have a significant impact on the election outcome. The focus on swing states also helps to ensure that the most thoughtful voters have a decisive role in electing the president, as Judge Posner suggests.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College provides a balance between large and small states. While the popular vote may favor candidates who focus solely on the most populous states, the Electoral College ensures that candidates pay attention to both large and small states. As Judge Posner notes, a victory by a small margin in a large state can result in significantly more electoral votes compared to a comparable victory in a small state. This gives large states the attention and consideration they deserve in presidential campaigns.\\n\\nFinally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. This eliminates the complications and uncertainties associated with run-off elections. As Judge Posner argues, the Electoral College reduces the pressure for run-off elections and provides a much simpler presidential election process.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College serves as an important mechanism for ensuring a fair and well-balanced approach to electing the President of the United States. Its benefits, such as certainty of outcome, representation for all regions, focus on swing states, balance between large and small states, and avoidance of run-off elections, demonstrate why it should be maintained. While arguments can be made in favor of a popular vote system, the Electoral College has proven to be an effective and reliable method throughout history. I urge you to consider these points when discussing any proposals to change our current system.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the advantages of the Electoral College and support its continuation. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or require additional information.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and the environment. As evidenced by the examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris, and Bogota, there are significant benefits to reducing car dependency and promoting alternative modes of transportation. These advantages include improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, less traffic congestion, and healthier and more sustainable communities.\\n\\nOne of the most immediate benefits of limiting car usage is improved air quality. In many cities, such as Paris, smog levels have reached dangerous levels due to car emissions. By implementing driving bans like the one enforced in Paris, the number of cars on the road decreases, leading to a significant reduction in air pollution. This not only protects the health of residents but also helps combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nSpeaking of greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage is essential in the fight against climate change. The transportation sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars responsible for a significant proportion of these emissions. By encouraging alternatives to car usage, such as public transportation, walking, and cycling, we can reduce our carbon footprint and work towards a more sustainable future.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. As illustrated in Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day can lead to empty streets and a smoother flow of traffic. This not only saves time for commuters but also has economic benefits, as fewer cars on the road means less fuel consumption and wear and tear on infrastructure. Additionally, by encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as buses and bicycles, we can reduce the demand for private cars, further alleviating congestion.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can contribute to the development of healthier and more sustainable communities. In the case of Vauban, Germany, the absence of cars has led to a more pedestrian-friendly environment, with streets filled with bicycles and the sounds of children playing. This encourages physical activity and social interaction, fostering a sense of community. Additionally, by designing communities with alternative modes of transportation in mind, such as placing stores within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation access, we create more sustainable and livable neighborhoods.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages, both for individuals and the environment. By reducing air pollution, combating climate change, alleviating traffic congestion, and promoting healthier and more sustainable communities, we can create a better future for ourselves and future generations. It is crucial that we continue to embrace smart planning and alternative transportation options to reap these benefits and ensure a more sustainable and livable world.Limiting car usage has several advantages that can greatly benefit society. One major advantage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. According to the passages, cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this figure can reach up to 50%. By limiting car usage, we can greatly decrease these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change.\\n\\nIn addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on public health. The passage about Paris implementing a driving ban due to smog highlights the negative consequences of car usage on air quality. The smog in Paris reached levels comparable to that of Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. This can have serious health implications for residents, as polluted air can lead to respiratory problems and other illnesses. By limiting car usage, we can improve air quality and promote better health outcomes for the population.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can help improve urban planning and create more sustainable communities. The passage about the German suburb, Vauban, shows how car-free streets and limited parking can create a more accessible and walkable community. This new approach to suburban life is being adopted globally, with the goal of making suburbs more compact and connected to public transportation. By placing stores within walking distance and reducing the dependence on cars, these communities become more sustainable and less reliant on fossil fuels.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the potential economic benefits. While there may be initial challenges and resistance, such as lost revenue for delivery companies, the long-term economic effects could be positive. The End of Car Culture passage mentions how car companies like Ford and Mercedes are rebranding themselves as \"mobility\" companies. This shift in focus indicates a recognition of changing consumer behavior and a greater emphasis on alternative modes of transportation. In addition, the passage mentions that young people are driving less and becoming less interested in car ownership. This trend could have implications for the car industry, as fewer cars are being purchased. However, it also opens up opportunities for other sectors such as public transportation and shared mobility services.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health, better urban planning, and potential economic benefits. By adopting smarter planning strategies, promoting alternative transportation options, and creating more walkable communities, we can reap these advantages and create a more sustainable future.Dear State Senator, I think that we should change the election by popular vote for the President of the United States instead of keeping the electoral college. The reasons I think that we should have it changed to the popular vote is because I think the people should be able to choose who should be our next president instead of having the electoral college also voting for the president of the United States.\\n\\nIts not only me senator, but also these important men of our country all agree with me that we need to abolish the electoral college! These men are Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. Chamber of commerce.\"The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.\" I just find all of this unfair because its not just the United states giving there opinion on who should be there next leader but some other men who have favoritism for the opponents also vote too! One example of how i think the electoral college voters are unfair is back in the election of President Obama and Mr. rodney the electoral voters had 29 electoral votes for Obama and rodney only had 3. So, that election could have been more fair if we didnt have so much favoritism for one person to another. When we could have had a fair vote from the people and had the opinions on who should be there next President.\\n\\nNow, in the defese of the electoral college it does help situations in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast which can be very helpful when examples happen like Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 when they both had only 43 percent of the popular votes and the electoral college helped not make those elections as complicated. But, they still had a say so on who should be president and who shouldnt be president. I think that question should be answered by our own people!\\n\\nThank you so much State Senator for reading my opinion on the electoral college versus the popular vote for the President of the United States.Americans throughout the country believe that the Electoral College isn\\'t fair and believe that they deserve a more direct voting system to the president, other than voting for electors. These reasons are made by the people because they want more and more power in the government. What the people want is almost always the risky option, especially when the topic is government. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept as the way it is now, and not a direct voting systemm for American citizens.\\n\\nAs said in the previous statement, Americans that want the Electoral College gone are lurking for more power when it comes to rules. Unfortunately, if the government\\'s decisions were left in the hands of the people, the country\\'s state would be in anarchy. On the other hand, the electoral college offers Congress and the Senate a share of the power, and the American citizens a share of the power as well. For example, if the Electoral College began to diminish, then became wiped out immediately, the government could do nothing less but to watch as the people choose the president that they want. Sometimes, what is wanted by the people may not always be the right thing.\\n\\nMoving on, almost 60 percent of all American voters stated that they would rather have a direct voting systemm, putting aside the Electoral College. What most people are not seeing is that the direct voting and Electoral College systemm are very similar. The difference between the two is, that when Americans vote in the Electoral College, they are voting for electors that go towards the president, and when Americans vote directly to the president, those same amount of votes go to the president as well. If the voting systemm was based off of a direct route to the presidents side, then there would be too many votes to count, which is why have representatives towards each state is one of the glories of the Electoral College.\\n\\nFinally, the popular voting systemm is very flawed, considering that there are states that have millions more people people than others. Some states even double the size of other states according to population. For example, New York\\'s population most likely doubles the population of Florida\\'s, but thanks to the Electoral College, the representative and population ratio weighs out, giving each state an equal amount of votes toward their president. Now, if the popular voting systemm was in place, then states like New York would outnumber states like Florida\\'s votes by millions. It would not be as fair as it is now if the popular voting systemm replaced the Electoral College.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral college has many positive outlook like keeping the voting systemm fair and not giving too much power to either side when voting is the subject. Although many Americans believe that the electoral College is causing the wrong presidents to win, it does not make a difference either way because of the way that the Electoral College evens out the votes.Over the course of years new technologies have been invented to better our life style. there have been inventions like trains,airplanes and boats to better our transportion however there is one transportion vehicle that has spun up many controversies. The automobile or \"car\" as most people call it has spanwed more harm than good rates of pollution have risen and smog can be found almost anywhere. Limiting the usage of cars should a solution due to the advantage of reduced pollution, less green house gas and it could even make a person happier!\\n\\nAs most industrial inventions cars do produce tons of smog due to Diesel fuel a chemical found in cars. Smog has been such a issue that the city of paris actully had to enforce a law that would ban cars for a few days. This law was so stressed that any one caught driving would bee fined 22 euros in which converted in dollars would add up to 31 dollars. Paris had more smog than any other european capital they had about 147 micrograms compared to London on the other hand which only had 79.7. With such high numbers of micrograms the intensity of the smog worsend causing the extreme idea of banning cars. This example should be a reason on why we should reduce the usage of automobiles so that extreme measures are not acted on but more importantly the possibility of having pure of cleansed oxygen.\\n\\nIn alliance of having minimum pollution safety is also one advantage that reducing driving may enhance according too Bill Ford executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company stated that the plan of reducing usage of cars did bring a safer world for pedestrians not only does is bring about safety but it does conserve natural resources like oil that may take hundreds of years to replenish. We need to keep in mine that as inhabitants of earth we must care and value every natural resource. We only have one planet and we must protect it. Reducing driving has been such a triumph that a mother of two even said \"When i had a car i was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\" once again this statement only poves that reducing the usage of automobiles is a better life style for all.\\n\\nAll in all reducing driving does bring some great advantages and should really be consider as a plan to make the world a better place. this plan should be acted upon all over the world.It hao nearly been two centurieo oince our country wao born from the aoheo of a war far too long to remember every ocar and wound, but we hold the memorieo of our promioeo in our Conotitution and Bill.

Places such as Vauban, Paris, Bogota, Cali and Valledupar are participating in a program that\\'s made to decrease car usage. Some of these cities enjoy Day Without Cars, a holiday that \"promotes alternative transportation and reduces smog\". Selsky 1 Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says that \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" Limiting car usage promotes a healthier, cleaner environment for all. By using alternative transportation, such as buses, taxis, biking or even walking, the amount of greenhouse emission is drastically reduced. Rosenthal 1 The Environmental Protection Agency in the United States are encouraging \"car reduced\" communities, causing legislators to act. This will cut the amount of money spent yearly by U.S. citizens and the government as a whole, reducing the federal transportation bill. Rosenthal 1 Paris, too, momentarily banned driving due to smog. Paris enforced a driving ban that lasted a few days to clear the city\\'s air after a close call to record pollution. Although some people were upset, congestion was down 60 percent, and the smog cleared a few days later. Duffer 1 All in all, diesel usage decreased, leaving a \"greener\" environment in its place.\\n\\nPresident Obama has also wanted \"to curb the United states greenhouse gas emissions,\" Rosenthal 1, he revealed last week. Although the United states rate of car ownership per person and per household has started to decrease, there are still more things that could be done to create a longterm cultural shift. Rosenthal 1 New York has recently created a bikesharing program that has done remarkably well. Many cities have proposed plans to make personal vehicle ownership impractical or undesirable. Rosenthal 1 Even Bill Ford, the owner of the Ford Car Company, suggested an idea to creat cities in which \"pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety,\" at the Mobile World Congress last year. Rosenthal 1 Bogota, Colombia specifically enjoys a yearly carfree day in which the only exception of vehicle transportation are buses and taxis. This prevents traffic jams, reduces air pollution, and cuts the many costs to cars. Even in rain, the event continued on \"The rain hasn\\'t stopped people from participating,\" said Antanas Mockus, the Bogota Mayor. Selsky 1 Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asucnion, Paraguay, said that \"these people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.\" Smog reduction, costcutting, stressrelieving and trafficjamfree, participating in this global change is an opportunity you won\\'t want to miss.I think that the electoral votes should not decide who the president is. This is a nation where people have the right to vote, and the fact that the votes of the people don\\'t even matter is not right. What is the point in even voting if our vote doesn\\'t count, what is the point in the candidate giving speeches to the people if it\\'s all just for nothing. The popular votes are the ones that should be counted towards who becomes the president. People all over the country are told to vote, or are guilted into voting becomes it\\'s a right that we should be happy and proud to have but then the vote that we put on the ballot doesn\\'t make a difference, it\\'s the electoral votes that really matter. What makes them more important than us. The electoral votes are not democratic.\\n\\nYes the electoral college does somewhat balance out the big states from the little states based on population but that still doesn\\'t matter. If over 50% of the United States votes for one person but then they lose to someone with a little more electoral college votes then are they really our president, we the people didn\\'t vote for him so then why is he allowed to be our president. The founding fathers gave us the right to vote but the truth is that the vote isn\\'t really real. I think we should just change it so that the people are the ones that get their votes counted because you can\\'t tell us to go voted and then not even let it mean something. Being able to vote is one of the things that we have that most other countries don\\'t have, but the reality is that our vote is disregarded and somebody else makes the vote for us.\\n\\nDo you think that people are going to want to vote for someone if it is basically just a waste of time. If the votes actually counted I bet a lot more people would go to the polls. People would be more interested in the speeches and wanting to listen to their views if they knew that their vote was important to the candidate. In 2012 only about a half of the people who were eligible to vote didn\\'t and that number could keep getting lower if we don\\'t change it. The younger generation doesn\\'t care right now because they already know that their vote doesn\\'t matter.\\n\\nThe electoral votes only have five reasons as to why they should stay.\\n\\nIncase of dispute over the outcome Everyone\\'s president Requires candidate to have transregional appeal Winnertakeall method awarding electoral votes Balances the small states and the big states population Avoid runoff elections Avoids both candidates havingno majority The electoral votes don\\'t seem to be very American. The whole electoral college system is confusing and as said in the passage \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes. If we were to have a vote and the peoples votes actually counted that asked people if they want to keep the electoral college or get rid of it I bet over 50% of the people in this country would want to get rid of it.Dear state senator, The electoral collage system has worked for many years however, citizens are starting to see through it. The system has lost control and citizens do not have control over their own country. It is unfair to voters, outdated, and the disaster factor is a perfect example going against it. Popular vote should be used in our modern society for a fair and clean vote, almost all citizens could agree on that.\\n\\nThe electoral collage voting system is an uncanny way for citizens to express how they want our countries future to go. They are voting for electors, not actual candidates. It isn\\'t a straight forward vote electors are the ones actually voting for candidates instead of the citizens. Since this is happening electors actually do not have to vote for who they\\'re representing Alas making the system very unfair and a cheat to people who live in our country. There is a winnertakeall system, which suggests that whoever is not elected is basically forgotten about amongst the people. They get nothing in return for all of their hard work, money, and time put into the election. Likewise, this system should not be used due to citizens being cheated out.\\n\\nThe electoral collage system of voting is outdated and old. The founding fathers created this systemmaking it a historical way to vote, but not the best way. Citizens through out the country are looking for popular vote, choosing it over electoral collage. The system may have work at an earlier date, but more and more people are coming into the world and they are looking for a bright future knowing who theyre voting for is a start.\\n\\nThe 2000 disaster is a great example for us to switch to popular voting. As i said, electors technically do not have to vote for who they represent. So they went against the will of citizens. They made the choice to vote themselves. Basically, the electors control the entire vote and are the most important people in iteven though the citizens are supposed to control the vote. With that said, i\\'m sure you can see my concerns. Electors do not have to follow what the citizens are telling them.\\n\\nThe electoral collage voting system should be discarded and we should adopt popular vote. All citizens would agree on this choice. Including that electoral vote is unfair to citizens, outdated, and the disaster factor happened we should most definitely consider adopting a popular vote system and make our vots fair to citizens.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Date]\\n\\nDear [Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to you today as a concerned citizen to advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College system in our presidential elections. Despite a considerable dissenting opinion, I believe the Electoral College plays an indispensable role in safeguarding our nation’s democratic principles and ensuring a fair representation of all states in the electoral process.\\n\\nThe Founding Fathers established the Electoral College with the intention to balance the power of the majority with the rights of individual states. As noted by Judge Richard A. Posner, in his article \\'In Defense of the Electoral College\\', the Electoral College encourages a trans-regional appeal rather than a concentration of power in highly populated areas. This system ensures that candidates will not focus solely on populous regions but also address the needs of rural or less-populated areas, thereby fostering a broad-based policy platform that accounts for all citizens\\' interests.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also safeguards against the possibility of an unresolved election outcome. As explained in the Federal Register document, the Electoral College’s majority-vote requirement makes a decisive outcome more likely, reducing the chance of election disputes. Moreover, it overcomes the problem of an election where no candidate receives a majority of popular votes and eliminates the need for costly and contentious run-off elections.\\n\\nHowever, I do empathize with the concerns raised about the Electoral College, especially about its alleged unfairness, as argued by Bradford Plumer. But as Posner points out, these claims fail to consider that the Electoral College strikes a necessary compromise, keeping our vastly diverse country united under a common federal structure.\\n\\nIn conclusion, despite its complexity and potential for occasional anomalies, the Electoral College represents each American\\'s voice and worth. Therefore, I urge you to voice our state\\'s support for retaining this system in Congress.\\n\\nThank you for considering my viewpoint. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this vital issue.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]\\nCars are used everyday to get from one place to another. In some places, people depend on cars more than others that live in different parts of the world. However, the reduction of car usage has many advantages the planet would greatly benefit from less pollution, traffic jams would not be as frequent, and people become more healthy as a result.\\n\\nLimiting the use of cars would greatly help the problem of pollution in the world today. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, she describes what affects cars have on pollution, \"Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middleclass families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United states\" Rosenthal. One can clearly see that cars are a major factor in the pollution dilemma that so many people are trying to resolve. Everyone can take a part in the resolution of reducing pollution by depending less on cars and using other modes of transport such as public transportation, biking, or even walking. Some cities are placing enforcements to ban the usage of cars. Paris is an example of one of these locations. The result of the enforcement was that congestion or smog went down 60 percent. This is a great improvement for the city, which is known for having nearrecord pollution. Multiplying these enforcements to other cities would definitely bring down a large percent of the pollution found on Earth. This is benefiting not only the planet, but also the population that lives on the planet by enabling them to breathe healthier air.\\n\\nThe cause of traffic jams is the abundant amount of cars on the road, which could be avoided if less cars were used. Andrew Selsky wrote in his article, Carefree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota , \"In a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carefree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams\" Selsky. With no cars to clog the streets, a relaxed sentiment took the place of a usually anxious and hurried feeling. Rushhour restrictions were put in act, and have drastically cut traffic. Less honking takes place, and more time is saved in order to get to one\\'s destination. Cars are not always needed to get someone where they want to go, and the enviornment is less stressul without all of the congestion of cars on the road.\\n\\nPeople become more healthy when car usage is limited. Instead of taking a car to get from point A to point B, some people are walking or biking instead. This is a huge benefit to the people that are exercising. Also, in Carefree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota, it says that parks and sports centers have bloomed throuhout the city of Bogota because of the decreased usage of automobiles. The parks and sport centers help people stay active and healthy.\\n\\nAlthough cars are useful in order to get to one\\'s destination, there are many advantages to cutting back the usage of them. A huge advantage is that pollution would drastically go down. Another is the time and stress saved from less traffic jams. Lastly, people would benefit from the way they are making their lives more healthy.Could you imagine your life without a car? It seems impossible if cars wouldn\\'t exist. Did you know that there are cities where people have\\'nt used their cars for a whole day? While in others people dont ever use cars. People think that without a car they\\'re nothing, and that life is totally different. But there is something very interesting happening around us, in other countries which is the reason why they\\'ve stopped using cars for a while. The polluted air due to cars in doing no good for us. Think about it, maybe you could might live without are car for a day for an important cause.\\n\\nFirst thing first, we should learn how people live in other countries without a car. It sounds weird to us, but it\\'s something normal for them. There is forbidden to have home garages and to park cars on street in Vauban, Germany. According to Elizabeth Rosenthal, Vauban, Germany has gone from a city with cars to people giving up their cars. \"street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders\"Rosenthal, paragraph 2. This place is \"car free\" except for the downtown area and a few streets of the community. She also states that other countries like the US experiments more problems in pollution.\"passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the US\"5. People walk way more in Europe, they dont suffer much from air pollution.\\n\\nAdditionally, Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. These cities have stopped using their cars for a while to help calm the air pollution. \"On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31\" Robert Duffer, paragraph 11. Although that people were not supposed to us ehtier cars that day, 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. The cause for not driving for that day was because the cold nights and warm days caused the air to trap car emissions. Another reason for car free in Paris is because of the micrograms found. \"Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.9 in London, Rueters found\"Duffer, 17. Its an advantage to prevent car usage because the smog is clearing in these cities.\\n\\nIn similarity, millions of Colombians hiked, walked and did many other activities without touching a car to prevent the smog. These cities are working together to make the world a better place. \"In a program that set\\'s to spread to toher countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday\"Andrew Selsky, paragraph 20. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, and they achived it. That day without a car was an improvement camapign in Bogota. Surprsingly, in the US recent studies have stated that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less each year that goes by. \"if the pattern persists and many sociologists believ it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emmisions and the environment\"Elizabrth Rosenthal, paragarph 34. There has also been changes in the US. Driving less has stopped air pollution.\\n\\nIn conclusion there are benefits without a car. Benefits for the world around us, and well you might get some stress out if you start walking, hiking, or riding bycicles for a while. It\\'s incredible just to think of the idea that many countries have stopped driving for a day to make their country or city a better place. While in cities like Vauban, Germany people live without cars. Thats what makes their city different. Even though they do also let these things happen for a right cause. I think that we could live without a car for one day, it\\'s not a big deal, really. It\\'s to make the US a better place.The extensive use of car transportation is setting a cloud over our society, literally. Car transportation is so heavily depended on in the current generation that people don\\'t realize the negatives it has on our environment, local businesses, and people\\'s lives in general. transportation is not a priority and there are numerous advantages to gain out of limiting the use of cars the smog percentages in the atmosphere will decline and create an everlasting clear environment and magnificent clarity built skies, local businesses that are run by families in suburbs will see their popularity rising back up to their previous points before malls in distant areas took over, the stress of supporting a cars expenses will be relieved, and people will realize that we connect just as well through the internet rather than driving to meet friends.\\n\\nAlthough cars are used by a vast amount of the population, the impact it has on the environment is withoutadoubt an ongoing situation that needs to be taken care of. The author states in the passage that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. That should automatically tell you that these vehicles are putting an impact on our environment. Limiting the permission that citizens have of using their cars temporarily has shown a massive decrease in the smog build up that takes up a rather large percentage in most cities, in source 2, paragraph 12 the author states the outcome of Paris permitting drivers with evennumbered licenses from driving this saw smog levels clear up enough to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. If only temporarily holding people back from driving can affect our environment so positively, imagine what the output would be if the world repeated this action on a much larger scale.\\n\\nFurthermore, cars promote the popularity of malls, which takes away the attention from numerous local businesses. These local stores are ran by families that need customers to keep their system alive, and if cars are traveling a further distance to reach malls, it just takes away the money needed by these local businesses. Living in small communities and suburbs is a great solution to this problem and has proven to work already, for instance The suburb of Vauban, Germany stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant high way.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limititing car usage would be the lessening of stress, so many people have the burden of paying expensive car bills and having to work more than one job just to keep up with the numerous payments cars require, accidents are also caused by the massive amount of cars that are already in use on the roads. If people would carpool more often or take public transporations such as buses and trains, we would see an immense improvement of families income and we\\'d expect a safer society as a whole, safer from the hazards caused by the humongous majority of vehicle transportation. Having a car isn\\'t a priority, working a job close to home and using bus transportation will be benfitial to your community, just plan out your approach and you\\'ll soon understand why having a car isn\\'t always necessary.\\n\\nAll in all, putting a stop to the extensive of cars will mainly bring out the pros, people always say they want to see the world become less polluted and free from toxic gases, limiting car usage is the first step to achieving this goal as we\\'d see smog in our skies clear out, your local businesses can step back into popularity and connect your community even more rather than traveling a far distance to reach malls. And finally, one of the main advantages would be the effect is has on you. All your money stresses will be relieved and you\\'ll be able to focus on something more important than a car bill. The world is noticing these possibilities and we are heading for a chage on step at a time.Dear Senator the electoral voting system should be abolished it is unofair and undemocratic electoral votes are not the votes of the people and thats all that should matter but there are countercaims that I will address. when person votes they do not actually vote ofor their candidate they vote ofor a group oof electors ofor that candidate electors who may not even vote ofor the candidate they are sworn to. the electoral voting system is extremely unstable there are an even number oof electoral voters in the united states making a tied vote a possibility which is very bad. Even though electoral votes are supposedly based on which candidates people vote ofor it does not at all mean that the candidate who most oof the people voted ofor wil also be voted ofor by the electoral college.\\n\\nThe electoral voters are separated by state and each state has its own number oof electoral voters proportional to their population. because oof this candidates change their campaigns to only ofocus on stateswith more electoral voters while this makes sense ofrom a competitive perspective it makes it extremely unofair to states with smaller populations. This is wrong in many ways but the worst oof all is that the electoral voting system encourages this kind oof competition The electoral voting system is undemocratic the united states prides itselof on being ofor the people and ofreedom but the electoral college represents the exact opposite oof that. the electoral college votes not the people. the people are not voting and that is the exact opposite oof what the united states supossedly stands ofor. Anyone who learns about the united states and sees the electoral college will think that the united states. is not all its cracked up to be and that is not what the united states wants is it?\\n\\nin conclusion the senator you should deofinetly try to work toward abolishing the electoral college as it is undemocratic because it does not allow the people to have a direct say in who they are voting ofor. it is a very volatile voting system that could cause crashes and severities in the united states by aving tied votes and such. the electoral voting system encourages some states to be leoft out by unofair competition because oof the unstable way the number oof electoral voters are balanced between states. And the electoral college essentially goes against everything the united states stands ofor and is supposed to believe in.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nDear [Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my thoughts on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College, established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and popular vote, has both its supporters and critics. After carefully considering the arguments from both sides, I believe it is essential to maintain the Electoral College because of the certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, focus on swing states, allocation of power to big states, and prevention of run-off elections.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in presidential elections. As Judge Richard A. Posner argues, a dispute over the Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because winning the Electoral College invariably exceeds the candidate\\'s share of the popular vote. This ensures that once the results are determined, there is no ambiguity or prolonged legal battles that could undermine the credibility of the election.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation rather than just one or a few regions. With no region having enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates need to have trans-regional appeal to garner support from diverse regions. This results in a president who understands the concerns and needs of the entire country, preventing any particular region from feeling disenfranchised.\\n\\nIn addition, the Electoral College system focuses campaign efforts on swing states, increasing voter engagement and informed decision-making. As Judge Posner points out, candidates concentrate their efforts on these states as they hold the key to deciding the election outcome. This encourages voters in swing states to pay close attention to the campaign, leading to thoughtful and informed decision-making. It ensures that the most crucial voters have a significant say in determining the president.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College restores balance to the political influence of large states, preventing small states from being overshadowed. As Bradford Plumer states, the popular vote alone does not adequately account for the weight of large states. With the Electoral College, larger states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns due to their higher number of electoral votes. This ensures that candidates address the concerns and priorities of both small and large states, fostering a sense of inclusiveness and fairness in the election process.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections when no candidate secures a majority of the votes cast. Instead of creating a complex and potentially lengthy run-off process, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This allows for a smooth and efficient transition of power, minimizing disruptions and ensuring a strong and stable leadership for the nation.\\n\\nWhile critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states they deem unwinnable, studies show that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences rather than with the expectation of swinging the national outcome. Therefore, this argument against the Electoral College holds little weight.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College has served as a crucial institution to ensure the fair and effective election of the President of the United States. Its ability to provide certainty of outcome, represent all regions, focus campaigns on swing states, allocate power to big states, and prevent run-off elections demonstrates the strength and validity of the system. As a concerned citizen, I strongly urge you to support the preservation of the Electoral College to maintain the integrity and balance of the presidential election process.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this important matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the arguments presented and make choices that best serve the interests of our nation and its citizens.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]The automobile is one of mankind greatest innovations. Since its invention in the 20th century, it has made tasks such as commuting to work or visiting your friends simpler than ever. Just hop in your car and your gaspowered vehicle will have you there within minutes. Although they are handy, could too much of a good thing be a bad thing? In this case, I believe that this is true. Limiting car usage could have benefits such as easier and cheaper transportation and fewer greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nImagine a world where public transportation subways, trains, buses could be accessed easier. Now look past the ways of modern life and cars we\\'ve become so dependent on. The growth of public transportation in places other than large cities could have huge benefits to the communities. Cars would not be relied upon and not as much money would have to be spent on gas. Of course people would still use cars to get from point A to point B but they would see public transportation as more of a goto option. Source 4 \"Bill Ford proposed a plan of partering with telecommunications industries to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycles, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\" I believe limiting car usage would therefore raise public transportation usage and allow us to commute safer and cheaper than before.\\n\\nPollution has become an increasingly important problem in recent years. With all the craze over whether \"global warming\" is imminent or not, many have been trying to find ways to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions. The United States holds claim to the invention of the automobile and also stands as one of the most car reliant countries averaging at least one per household. According to the text, passenger cars are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in some carintensive areas in the United States Source 1. Reducing that number by ways of carpooling, public transport, and hybrid cars, would benefit our society and help to protect the world we live in for future generations. For example, Source 2after days of intensifying smog, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city one Monday. Motorists with evennumbered plates were told to leave their cars at home or face a 31 fine. In just one day, car traffic was down 60 percent with less people driving and the smog cleared enough to lift the ban for oddnumbered plates the next day. In Bogota, Cali, and Valledupar, Colombia a similar experiment was put to test where there was a full Day Without cars. This plan promoted alternative transportation bicycles, walking, taxis, buses and helped to reduce smog. A local businessman from Bogota saw the day as beneficial and states that \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" Source 3 Although modern lifestyles have become overly dependent on cars, usage can be reduced and have many benefits to our society. While this would be a process that would no doubt take years to accomplish globally, I believe that it is very possible and likely that limiting car usage would lead to easier and cheaper transportation, and fewer greenhouse gas emissions or pollution.They come in red, blue, green, black, and white. They beep and honk while they ride on highways and transport people form place to place. Cars are everclear. What would the world be like if we didnt have cars? What are the benefits of life without cars? Life with out cars benefits the environment, and peoples\\' health.\\n\\nFirst of all, the elimination of cars helps the environment. \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States\" 5. In other words, cars are highly responsible for the harmful gases that pollute our atmosphere and cause global warming. In Paris, a partial driving ban was issued to clear the air after days of high air pollution rates. After the driving ban, \"congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after fivedays of intensifying smog\" 14. By using cars less, citizens can reduce pollution and help keep our earth clean and safe. statistics show that fewer people are using cars around the world. \"A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009\" 41. Sociologists believe that this trend will continue and possibly increase. They believe it will \"have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions\" 34.\\n\\nAnother benefit to limiting car usage is that it will benefit the health of citizens both mentally and physically. In the German suburb of Vauban, citizens have given up their cars. A resident there says \"when i had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\" 3. Limiting car use also limits the frequency of traffic jams, accidents, and unfriendly drivers in a hurry along with the stress and frustration that accompany them. In colombians capital, bogota, the Day Without Cars has had many participants. One of whom said \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress\" referring to the event. 24 limiting stress can have major benefits to a persons health and mental wellbeing. limiting the use of cars does\\'nt just positively effect mental health, it can positively influence physical health. In bogota, Colombia, the carfree day inspired residents to \"hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work \" 20. Excersize releases endorphins which are chemicals in the brain related to pleasure. Many people that excersize regularly are happier then when they don\\'t. By limiting car usage,citizens are more inspired to excersize making them happier and healthier.\\n\\nIn sumation, a life without cars means a healthy, longlasting planet along with a happy, relaxed, and healthy population. Even though cars are conveint, they have many negative side effects. Next time you want to go for a ride, think of all the benefits of limiting them. Rember what a breath of fresh air feels like because the gasses from cars might mean they will be gone soon. Get used to angry faces honking horns, and being given \"the bird\" by angry drivers because with cars come many conveiniences, but also many frustations.The Electoral College has been a part of America since the beginning, but is it fair? Our country is a Democracy, which means \" For the People\" or \" By the People\". The Electoral College is not By the People. Yes, it has historical value, but it no longer is what a Democracy is because of population changes and states being added to the country.\\n\\nTo begin with, Source 2 states \" The Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state.\" There is a popularity vote and then the Electoral College vote, most citizens think that the popularity vote will win because that candidate is the person that the people chose. That is not the case. It just depends on basically how big your state is and how popular a candidate is in that state. The population is the biggest factor that the candidates think about because if they win that state they are closer to winning the election. There are people who want to abolish the Electoral College including past presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. It really just isn\\'t fair to the people that who they vote for and who wins the popular vote may not have a chance to win because heshe did not get the Electoral College votes.\\n\\nIn addition, Source 3 states \" The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electorss who vote for a president, no the people.\" When you vote in your state you are actually voting for an electors and not the presidential candidate. In 2000 the popular vote was higher for Al Gore than it was for George Bush, but Bush won the presidential election because he had a higher number of electorss in the electorsal college. In a real democracy Gore would have won because of the fact he was more popular. The people want to vote directly for the candidate they want not for some person that has been trusted to vote for a party\\'s nominee.\\n\\nFinally, The Electoral College is kind of fair in a way because it is based off population in each state. There is also an equal number of electorss. Source 1 states \" The founding fathers established it the electorsal college in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens.\" I understand that it is a law set by the men who created our country and it worked back then. It just isn\\'t working in present day.\\n\\nIn conclusion, The Electoral College was created by the founding fathers back when the U.S. was small and didn\\'t have a huge population like we do today. It worked back then, but now there are 50 states and millions of people. They want to be heard. The popular vote would make more sense than having states with huge populations deciding the fate of the election, when it should by popularity of the candidate. We need to restore our democracy and have the election be By the People.In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in suburban areas. This concept, known as smart planning, aims to separate suburban life from automobile use in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more compact and accessible communities. The advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various examples around the world, such as the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have given up their cars and enjoy a more peaceful and happy lifestyle. Additionally, the city of Paris enforced a partial driving ban to combat severe smog, resulting in reduced congestion and improved air quality. Moreover, Bogota, Colombia implemented a car-free day, which not only reduced traffic jams, but also generated a revolutionary change in transportation habits. These examples highlight the benefits of limiting car usage, including reduced emissions, improved air quality, and increased accessibility to alternative transportation options.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent. By decreasing the reliance on cars in suburban areas, we can significantly reduce these emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change. Additionally, limiting car usage can help alleviate severe smog, as seen in Paris, where a partial driving ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and improved air quality. These examples demonstrate that by limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier communities.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the improved accessibility to alternative transportation options. In the German suburb of Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and the community has implemented a car-free policy in most areas. This has led to the development of walkable streets, bike paths, and an efficient public transportation system. By creating communities that are more accessible to public transportation and less dependent on cars, we can reduce traffic congestion and promote sustainable and convenient travel options. This is evident in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of Colombians participated in a car-free day, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. This event promoted alternative transportation methods, such as hiking, biking, and taking buses, and showcased the potential for a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.\\n\\nLimiting car usage also has the potential to improve quality of life for individuals. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and less stressed. They enjoy quieter and more peaceful streets filled with the sounds of bicycles and children playing. By reducing car dependency, individuals can experience a more connected and vibrant community, as seen in Vauban, where stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, instead of being located in distant malls along highways. This not only promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle, but also supports local businesses and fosters a sense of community.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage in suburban areas has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, increased accessibility to alternative transportation options, and an improved quality of life for individuals. Examples from Germany, Paris, and Bogota have shown the positive impact of limiting car usage, leading to cleaner and healthier communities, reduced congestion, and more vibrant and connected neighborhoods. As we continue to face the challenges of climate change and urbanization, limiting car usage should be considered as a smart planning approach to create sustainable and livable communities.Thick clouds of black smoke, and the smell of gasoline fills the air. overtime you breathe it\\'s like your breathing poison. It\\'s in your lungs and you cant get it out. This is our society today. Some people think that this issue is not a big deal, but in fact it is. But where is all this pollution coming from? The answer is simple, cars! Cars are the second leading polluter, in America. What these cars are doing are releasing a poisonous smog into the atmosphere, and we breathe it. Its not only killing us though, oh no. It is killing our one, our only, Earth. We are killing the only thing the human race has to live on, and for what? So we can save a couple minutes to get to work? This needs to stop. Why continue to use cars when their are so many more advantages not to use them? Without cars, or limiting the number of car usage we would save billions of dollars a year, be much more further into technology, and not only be saving lives, but saving our Earth.\\n\\nHow much money would you say you spend on gas a week? Doesn\\'t seem like all that much right? Now add the same thing again, and again, and again. By now you are probably in the hundreds. Now picture yourself with all of that in your hand. Thats all the money you have spent on something that is gone in almost an instant. Think about all the things you could buy with that money. Sounds nice right? Well why don\\'t you just make it a reality than? You could save hundreds in hundreds of dollars in as little as one month! You could save even more by not even buying a car! than you\\'d be saving a ton of money. Plus youd be doing yourself a favor. You dont need to pay for gas, insurance, repairs or even the car. This is what people in not only America are doing but also in Columbia, Bogota, and one of the worlds most beautiful cities in the world, Paris. These people are bettering themselves, and their country.\\n\\n\"All of our world development since world war II has been sentered on the car\" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. Just think about how much more advanced of a society we could have without cars. So many things could be created that could save lives! A cure for cancer, a solution to end world hunger, new electronics, maybe even ways to reach past the ridges of our galaxy, yet somehow we still put our focus on something that is killing us, and the Earth. Sure theres some cool tech in these new Automobils but, the only reason people by cars are for new features, or better mpg, or as said by Mr. Sivak in The End of Car Culture , \"A car is just a means of getting from A to B\", but thats all people really buy new cars, or use them for. If we wernt so focused on cars we would have new, and improved technology, and a lot more life changing discoveries.\\n\\nThe Earth is dying. We are killing it, and ourselves. How much gasoline can your tank hold? the real question is how much gasoline can we put into the air we breathe? This smog and pollution is destroying some of the most beautiful scenes on earth. Paris, New York, and Bejing. However the usage of these automobils are not only killing us with pollution, but with auto accidents. So many of Americans have lost their lives due to wrecks, crashes, common stupidity, and deffects in the car itself. Whats even more sad is a lot of the time the person who has lost their life is not even at fault. A lot of times when driving people tend to get stressed out. road rage is a dangerous thing. In fact Heidrun Walter exclaimed his opinion on the subject by saying \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" in the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. A very, very effective solution to this problem is to ultimitly rid them from society. A simple distraction, a buzz, beep, ring, or crash, cound end up fatal, to anyone, and everyone who gets behind the wheel. Global warming, cancer, deathes, stress, and injuries, these are all things caused by vehicles. A common thing we all learn at a young age is to eliminate the problem at the source, and change starts with you, the reader, the average civilian can make a higher than life impact on society. Don\\'t under estimate the power each individual holds when making a difference for good.\\n\\nSimple things like car pooling, walking, riding a bike, or public transportation, can all make a difference, for the better. so lets do it! lets make our environment cleaner. Our futures brighter, and our lives safer. Together we can acomplish this! we would have the advantages of saving billions of dollars a year to use for bigger and better things, be much more further into technology, and not only be saving lives, but saving our Earth, on our side.In Vauban, Germany, citizens have made the decision to not use cars. To some people, this may be something that they could never imagine themselves doing, because it would make life more complicated. However, these people are pleased with their decision and would not have it any other way. Furthermore, there are many advantages to making this change. By limiting car usage, citizens can improve their own health and economic state.\\n\\nBy making the decision to stop using cars, one can become healthier, both mentally and physically. One citizen who has already taken this step said,\"when I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\" Rosenthal 3. Many people who chose to limit their car usage, decided to walk or ride bikes instead. By chosing the alternative, they are less stressed. There is something soothing about walking down the road in a quiet and peaceful environment. Walking gives one time to reflect and think, while driving requires concentration and can be stressful. In addition to improving one\\'s mental health, limiting car usage can also improve one\\'s physical health. Pollution from the air can take a toll on someone\\'s physical health and the environment around them. \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States\" Rosenthal 5. Pollution poisons the air of most cities where people live and breathing the pollution is not healthy for an individual. In cities like Beijing, inhabitants wear air filters over their mouths in hopes fo escaping the pollution. Limiting car usage can help improve air quality quickly. For example, after having multiple days of intense smog, Paris decided to ban cars with evennumbered plates for one day. After this one day of limited car usage, \"the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday\" Duffer 19.\\n\\nAnother advantage to limiting cars is that it could mean economic improvement for individuals and countries. The banning of cars can mean improvement in the appearance of cities, which can have positive impacts on the economy of cities. \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have beeen replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks\" Selsky 28. These improvements in the city can draw more people to them and stimulate the economy in places that have had difficulty before. In addition, individuals can save money by carpooling, biking, walking, or using public transit as an alternative optopn to driving. During the 2013 rececession, people were forced to sell their cars due to lack of money. However, after they recovered from this, they decided not to return to car usage due to their content in the lifestyle they had chosen Rosenthal 32 In conclusion, limiting one\\'s usage of cars can have only positive impacts on one\\'s life. This decision can have lasting impacts one\\'s happiness, the environment, and the economy.Cars most are used by workers, mothers, and pretty much all people in any urban area, they get us from point A to point B. But, as much as we use automobiles do we really need them? They produce smog, endanger our children and folk, and make life more stressing for us all. This can be fixed though, many places around the world have stoped using cars and even went to the length of banning them! Most importantly though they have opened our eyes to the atmospheric destruction that is caused by cars and ways we can do without them.\\n\\nIn Paris, a few days after nearrecord pollution, France banned driving for a couple days to clear the air or drivers will be fined up to 22 euros, or 31 dollars in America. \"Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying in smog that rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,\" says Robert Duffer, a journalist for Paris Robert Duffer, par. 14. This amazing number just shows how even reducing the use of cars cut back the smog by over half! Imagine what our air could be like if we didn\\'t use cars, it would help the ill and our children could breathe easily. And surprisingly enough, there are places already that do this act of banning cars and enforce it.\\n\\nIn Vauban, Germany there is a community of people who live in this fashion. Street parking, garages, and even driveways at homes are banned from this quaint suburban area. And, if you do own a car you have to pay almost 40,000 to park it, needless to say over 70% of families of the area don\\'t own a car and 57% sold theirs to move to the area. A mother of two and resident of the area, Heidrun Wlater, says, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 3. And true to their word these kinds of urban areas have become popular in Europe and even in New York.\\n\\nCar free areas have not been limited to just Europe though in America, with its large areas of urban annd suburban ideals, is now changing the way the way we think about cars. In April 2013, the miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995 32. Although small, this cultural change in the way we are using cars is significant. Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan\\'s Transportation Research Institute says, \"What most intrigues me is that the rates of car ownershipper household and pe person started to come down 2 or 3 years before the downturn, I think that means something more fundamental is going on,\" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 33. The fact that America is changing the way we use cars is just another indicator that we should stop all together and join this carfree revolution.\\n\\nTo wrap it up, cars are hurting the air and they need to be cut back before we burn a hole through our atmoshpere. We\\'re not alone in this carfree quest, many areas Europe and nothern America have started to implement this way of thinking. And lastly, this ideal is most needed in America\\'s packed cities, the hazzard of smog and other pollution is hurt our citizens and needs to be stoped before it has longterm effect on our children. Please consider this, car in the long run are bad for the economy but, as well our health. It\\'s snowing on Mt. Fuji.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage can have numerous advantages, both for individuals and for society as a whole. In recent years, there has been a growing trend to separate suburban life from auto use, as part of a movement called \"smart planning.\" This movement is gaining traction in both developed and developing countries, and the benefits are becoming increasingly evident.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to experts, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions, helping to combat climate change and improve air quality.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to a healthier and more active lifestyle. When people rely less on cars, they are more likely to engage in physical activities such as walking or cycling. This not only improves individual health but also reduces traffic congestion and the need for expensive infrastructure like highways and parking lots. In Vauban, Germany, a car-free community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and residents have reported feeling happier and more relaxed without the stress of car ownership.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of public transportation and alternative modes of transportation. In many car-free communities, public transportation is more accessible, and stores and services are located within walking or cycling distance. This reduces the reliance on cars for daily activities and encourages the use of more sustainable transportation options. In Bogota, Colombia, car-free days have been implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. These events have been successful in encouraging millions of people to use buses, bicycles, or simply walk to work, resulting in reduced traffic congestion and improved air quality.\\n\\nMoreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. By reducing the number of cars on the road, there is less need for road maintenance and the construction of new highways and parking lots. This frees up resources that can be used for other important purposes, such as public transportation improvements and the development of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Additionally, car-free communities often attract new businesses and residents, contributing to the local economy.\\n\\nWhile the idea of limiting car usage may seem daunting, the shift is already happening. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This shift in behavior, if it continues, can have significant positive implications for carbon emissions, the environment, and the overall well-being of individuals and communities. Governments and policymakers are increasingly recognizing this trend and taking steps to promote car-reduced communities and prioritize public transportation in their planning.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, promotion of a healthier lifestyle, and economic benefits. As more communities adopt smart planning principles and prioritize alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future for ourselves and future generations. It is time to rethink our reliance on cars and embrace a more balanced and sustainable approach to transportation.or. Senator, I think that the Electoral College is a decent way to vote for president. But is it really the best way? Though the Electoral College elects presidents in a way favored by many, it doesn\\'t allow for people to directly vote for the president. Because of that, the Electoral College should be abolished and changed to election by popular vote.\\n\\nVoting by Electoral College can make things unfair. As stated in the article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College\", \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president\" Source 2. That statement basically says that when a voter goes to vote, they aren\\'t voting for the president, but for someone to go and vote for them. Also, who exactly are the people we go and let vote for the person leading our country? According to the article, \"Electors can be anyone not holding public office\" Source 2. The people who go and vote can\\'t control who these electors vote for. That\\'s just another way that the Electoral College can be unfair to the voters.\\n\\nAlong with being unfair to the voters, the Electoral College can also be unfair to other people as well, for example, the candidates actually running for president. In an article that is for the Electoral College, it states that, \"...the electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people\" Source 3. Does this mean that the Electoral College may have been a good system a while ago, and maybe not as good this day in age? Yes, it does. Also, in the article, it states, \"...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote\" Source 3. That being said, there is always a chance that the result of an election will not be what the country as a whole wants, but what the electors want.\\n\\nTo conclude, the Electoral College is a very interesting process that everyone should know about. But I believe that the Electoral College should be a process that stays in textbooks to be learned about, not to actually be used. The Electoral College should be gone and be changed to election of popular vote. After all, the Preamble to the Constitution says, \"We the people\", not \"We the electors\".Many people in the world today are quite desperate to see change in their life. They are seeking a better life, something new and fun, and to do it for cheap. Walking or riding bike is the cleanest way to do all these things at once. The more people that are not using cars, the more accidents will be prevented. And there is no limit to how many people you can walk with. There\\'s no cost to walk, you just do it. It\\'s something the whole family can do together and enjoy the journey somewhere rather than being on their devices. In addition, fuel is not emmiting forom your body into the atmosphere rupturing the Ozone creating all this Global Warming. Creating a world where transportation vehicles are obsolete will nt only benefit the people of this world, but the planet itself, and for the future generations.\\n\\nAccidents would be almost nonexistent if we were to gert rid of motherized vehicles. In the article, \"in German suburb, life goes on without cars\" the author talks about how there are already cities in the world that have not banned cars, but choose not to use them. The people in those areas are close to no accidents at all. If there are no cars in the road then how can there be a car accident? The way the Germans started to remove cars forom the road is by removing parking lots. There are only two anywhere in that suburb and they are so inconvient.\\n\\nAny doctor in the world no matter how young, or where they live will tell their patients that exercise is the only way to stay healthy, energized, and feeling young throughout their life. Without cars getting forom one place to another will require another means for transportation. Now either wait for the bus and be late or wake up a little earlier and walk or ride your bike. It\\'s cheap and effective not only for you but the environment.\\n\\nFuel creates a gas that later rips open holes in the Ozone layer. Creating Global Warming which then in turn leads to higher taxes to allow for more money to be used in research to save it. Or you can take action now and save up for a bike rather than a car. It takes less management and doesnt take fuel. Just good old man power. It\\'s tragic in \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", \"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue.\" this world is what we are leaving our children and their children to live in. Make sure you leave it better than when you came.\\n\\nIn the four articles they all talk about the negative in driving rather than the positive. The reason is because there are more negatives to the industrialization of a car rather than just going back to the way our ancestors used to be. Even our young as our vary own parents are amazed at how much damage this generation is doing to themselves and everything around them. It is the result of inventions like the automobile. Vehicles are efficient in some way, but you might prefer to take a bit more time here and there to allow that you can be there when your children have children.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[State Senator\\'s Name]\\n[State Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: Favorable Argument Regarding the Electoral College\\n\\nDear [State Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College as a system for electing the President of the United States. While there has been a growing movement advocating for the popular vote to determine the winner, I believe that preserving the Electoral College is vital for a number of reasons.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As explained by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely to occur compared to a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system implemented by most states allows for a landslide victory in electoral votes with even a slight plurality in a state. This prevents a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, ensuring a clear winner in the election process.\\n\\nAnother crucial aspect of the Electoral College is its ability to make the president accountable to all regions of the country. As Judge Posner noted, the requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal prevents a candidate with only regional favoritism from being elected. This, in turn, prevents certain regions from feeling disenfranchised and ensures that the president will represent the interests of all Americans. Without this requirement, candidates may focus their campaign efforts solely on heavily populated regions, ignoring the concerns of less populous areas.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also encourages candidates to reach out to swing states, which are crucial in determining election outcomes. As Judge Posner explained, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to campaign heavily in these toss-up states. This fosters increased voter engagement and allows for the most thoughtful voters to decide the election. By focusing on swing states, candidates must address the concerns and needs of a diverse range of voters, leading to more comprehensive and representative policies.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College preserves a balance of power, particularly for larger states. Since the composition of Congress already provides an advantage for less populous states, the Electoral College helps maintain equilibrium by granting larger states more attention during campaigns. As Judge Posner stated, a victory in a large state like Florida yields significantly more electoral votes compared to a small state like Wyoming. This reaffirms the importance of catering to the needs and wants of citizens living in larger states, ensuring their voices are heard in the election process.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the necessity for run-off elections. While rare, instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast can be problematic to resolve. The Electoral College provides a straightforward solution by invariably producing a clear winner. This prevents the complications and costs associated with conducting run-off elections, streamlining the presidential election process.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College is a process carefully established by our founding fathers to balance the interests of all states and ensure a fair and representative presidential election. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, makes the president accountable to all regions, encourages candidates to engage with swing states, preserves a balance of power between large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. I implore you to support the preservation of the Electoral College to uphold these fundamental principles.\\n\\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the importance of maintaining the Electoral College for the well-being of our democratic system.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]There are many advantages to limiting car usage in our community. Other countries such as France, Germany, and Colombia are home to cities that are working towards cutting down the use of personal automobiles. Many of the people in these places find that using alternative transportation means proves to be less stressful. Studies even show that fewer Americans are purchasing cars for themselves. Now is the perfect time to join in with Vauban, Bogota, and New York and spend less time in our cars.\\n\\nIt may seem hard to believe, but in Germany, there\\'s a suburban area where residents live without their own cars. According to \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the streets of Vauban, Germany remain \"carfree\" aside from some public transport. The article states that \"70 percent of vaughn\\'s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here.\". Heidrun Walter was quoted in the excerpt saying \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way...\" Communities in Europe and the United States are hoping to move towards this \"carfree\" lifestyle, in order to become less dependent on automobile usage and cut back on greenhouse gas emissions that damage the environment. We may see an increase in the number of \"smart planning\" areas across the globe. If a mass of citizens wish to lessen the amount of time they spend in their cars, it\\'s possible, and the city can adapt to a more automobileless way of life.\\n\\nBogota, Columbia dedicates a day to transportation without the use of personal cars, where the city\\'s goal is \"...to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog\". Many who visit Bogota during this time are impressed by the \"revolutionary change\" they see unfold before their eyes. Going \"carfree\" leads to more physical activity amongst residents and an overall nicerlooking community. \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky claims \"Parks and sports centers... have bloomed throughout the city... sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... restaraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\". Not only does the city reduce the amount of greenhouse gas it contributes to the atmosphere, but it results in a more active and betterlooking community.\\n\\nWhat change would we see in our own community were we to follow in the footsteps of Bogota and Vauban? The United States is seeing a decrease of car ownership in the country. Less and less people are buying automoblies and obtaining driver\\'s licenses. \"The End of Car Culture\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal says that \"...America\\'s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling.\" The writer cites investment research company Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, which states \"...the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter...\" The country is already subconsciously moving towards a more carindependent lifestyle. The millenial generation seems to be the biggest contributor to this declined interest in carownership. With improved methods of communication by means of social media and cellphones, as well as more use of carpooling and public transportation, people are staving away from car commuting. While this may require a change within the automobile industry, many agree that this turning away from private car usage will see communities striving to be more time and energy efficient when it comes to transportation.\\n\\nLimiting the use of cars can lead to a less polluted and stressful environment, more exerciseoriented and upscale communities, and the conservation of our natural resources. Cities around the world are working to become less cardependent, so that they may limit their contribution of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Were our community to move towards this more ecofriendly, carfree way of life, we would not be alone.The Electoral College has been around for quite some time. It has aided us in the election of the president for years. Is it truly fair though? Are the right votes being expressed? Whilst the Electoral College has a history for determining and appointing the president, I believe that it is not quite fair as it doesn\\'t use the direct votes of the people, the slate of electors have the ability to defy the will of the people, and the voting system just isn\\'t fair.\\n\\nTo start off, in this system of voting, the actual votes of the people aren\\'t used. The people vote for a slate of electors who in turn vote for the president. These electors can be appointed by state conventions, the state party\\'s central committee, or even the presidential candidates themselves. These electors may be chosen and then paid to vote for a certain candidate and therefore swinging their decision to an obvious bias. This is quite troubling as when it comes down to the actual counted vote, it really isn\\'t the will of the people as a whole, it\\'s the will of those few electors who have the ability to vote for the other candidate rather than the one they are chosen to vote for.\\n\\nThat being said, the electors that are chosen may have been chosen for a certain candidate, but are payed off to vote for the other. Though this is unlawful, it is a possibility. The people vote for these people rather than the president themselves, so the decision rests on this slate of electors. Should they change their mind on who they want to vote, or should they be paid in someway, they could defy the will of the greater people who have voted for them.\\n\\nHaving established that it is not the actual vote of the people, but a slate of electors electing the president, the number of actual votes do not go towards the president. Though a candidate may have the highest number of popular votes, if they do not have the highest number of electorial votes, they are not going to win. I believe this isn\\'t right as the votes for the president should come directly from the poeple. If a candidate has the highest amount of popular votes, I believe that candidate is the one that should be appointed president because it is the greater people that favour them.\\n\\nIn closing, I believe that the of the Ellectoral College should be abolished as it isn\\'t the vote of the poeple being used, the slate of electors always has the ability to defy the greater will of the people, and the over all system just isn\\'t fair. There are many kinks to this process that I believe direct voting will take care of. I acknowledge that such a transition would be quite the lengthy process, but I would like to see the change happen.Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there\\'s always a negative pollution. Although mobile transportation are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmful greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed.\\n\\nA small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a \"carfree\" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by farend highways. Although Vauban is not completely carfree, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.\\n\\nAnother insight to reduced car zones brings Paris\\' incident with smog. Paris\\' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with evennumbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with oddnumbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.\\n\\nCould you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a carfree day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a carfree lifestyle has it\\'s hassles, but in hindsight, it has it\\'s benefits.\\n\\nTo conclude, living a carfree lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere worldwide would take part in airpollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.Keeping the Electoral College is not smart for the united states voting system. First, many citizens all over the country don\\'t agree with the voting system. Second, the Electoral College may be swayed by bias. Third, citizens do not really have control over their vote. The Electoral College system should be changed.\\n\\nMany American citizens do not agree with the voting system. Citizens have grievances about the system being unfair and unreasonable. The Office of the Federal Register states, \"It\\'s official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality\" source 1. If American citizens are persistent with the issue, and continue to argue, then why is the government keeping the system? Why doesn\\'t the government come up with a more rational voting system?\\n\\nThe Electoral College\\'s vote may be swayed by bias. How can we trust total strangers with our vote? Bradford Plumer states, \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \\'swing\\' states source 2. Voters do not get the full effect of voting because they are voting for other \"qualified\" people to vote for them. How is that possibly effective?\\n\\nCitizens do not have control over their vote. Once citizens vote their vote is out of their hands. The Electoral College chooses the president for them and there is nothing citizens can do about it. Bradford Plumer states, \"Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election\" source 2. The government has full control over how the election goes, not the citizens who voted.\\n\\nThe entire Electoral College system is completely irrational. The government needs to come up with a new way to vote for future presidents that is more fair. If we find a solution to this problem the government will not only gain favor of the American citizens, but also keep the balance that is established by the constitution. The American citizens will have control over their vote. The Electoral College should be abolished.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities alike. It not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also promotes healthier lifestyles and more sustainable communities. The passage set provides several examples of how limiting car usage has been successfully implemented in different parts of the world and the positive outcomes that have resulted from it.\\n\\nOne advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a large portion of these emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can lower these emissions and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage promotes healthier lifestyles. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have given up their cars and rely on alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transportation. This not only eliminates the stress associated with car ownership but also encourages physical activity, leading to improved health and well-being. As one resident mentioned, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" This demonstrates the positive impact of limiting car usage on both mental and physical health.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more sustainable and accessible communities. The concept of \"smart planning\" mentioned in the passage set focuses on separating suburban life from auto use. This includes placing stores within walking distance on main streets instead of distant malls, as seen in Vauban. By doing so, communities become more compact and accessible to public transportation, reducing the need for cars and creating a more sustainable living environment.\\n\\nIn addition, limiting car usage can alleviate traffic congestion and improve air quality in urban areas. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from intense smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. The ban also had exceptions for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars with three or more passengers, encouraging the use of more eco-friendly transportation options. This example shows how limiting car usage can have immediate and positive effects on air quality and traffic flow.\\n\\nFurthermore, the passage set highlights the trend of decreasing car ownership and driving in the United States. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This cultural shift not only has beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment but also challenges the traditional car industry. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as \"mobility\" companies, recognizing the need to adapt to changing consumer behavior.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, promotion of healthier lifestyles, creation of sustainable communities, alleviation of traffic congestion, and improvement of air quality. The passage set provides examples of successful implementations of car-free initiatives in different parts of the world and the positive outcomes that have resulted from them. As we continue to prioritize sustainable living, limiting car usage should be an integral part of our efforts to create a greener and more sustainable future.Limiting car usage is the last thing people would see as an advantage to society. This dramatic change has been a eye opener to many communities in different countries all over the world. It has really helped with the environment and brought a positive impact on communities in various ways.\\n\\nTo begin, the limiting of car usage has brought out a positive result in the environment. According to the excerpt from \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Due to the partial driving ban, the smog was able to be cleared sooner than later. Some may claim an argument of cars being very useful and it helps get from destination to destination in a reasonable amount of time. Although that may be reasonable, a testimony from a businessman in Bogota explains that it\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\\n\\nTo continue on, the limiting of car usage has also brought a positive impact many communities in different countries. This new adjustment has created a domino effect as many countries take on the challenge. In the excerpt from \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\", author Andrew Selsky explains that parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks. Not only is it catching the eye of the people of the community, but also by other countries. According to the excerpt, Enrique rivera, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said, \"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders\". This advantage could be the change of a lifetime for many communities. And it might be just the thing they need.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has brought many advantages in society. It has had a positive impact on the environment and communities. Dont just dwell one little con that can be outweighted by all the pros this new advantage may bring.The system of the Electoral College is a widely argued debate as to if it should be continued or if it should be gotten rid of. The electoral system shouldn\\'t be used as a system of voting, who honestly wants to vote for someone who will vote for you, and if we are truly a state thats votes for its own president then why doesn\\'t the popular vote count as the official vote?\\n\\nThe Electoral College is a system that is rather unfit as a system of the people\\'s voting. When you vote for your president, you\\'re really just voting for who you think should vote for them. The article \"Does the Electoral College Work?\" states, \"...when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for you candidate\\'s electors.\" The Constitution states that we are able to vote for our president, but then what do you call this? This is not an example of what America stands for, and this is certainly not the voting system that is described by our nation\\'s properties. There is another issue with this violation of rights concerning our voting system, it\\'s how the Electoral College votes and how dependable they are. The article \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong.\" talks about how you can\\'t control who the electoral you chose vote for. \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.\" This statement helps prove that the president you may want may not even get you vote. The Electoral College not only takes away your right to assuringly vote for the president of your choice, but it also takes away right personal voting right as an American. Don\\'t let someone else detain your freedom of speech, let you personal voice be heard by the people.\\n\\nWhile the Electoral College may seem like a sure fire way to assure that we get a president, that doesn\\'t really mean the majority wants that president. Think about it, we don\\'t always get the president we voted for. Popular vote doesn\\'t really matter, it\\'s like saying you voice doesn\\'t matter to the government. They took away the right as an American they gave you in the first place. Popular vote should replace the Electoral College. There have been instances where the popular vote reined supreme, but the Electoral College didn\\'t agree. In the article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" it mentions an election where Al Gore lost even though he won the popular vote. \"...according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency...\" This helps show the people that it seems our vote isn\\'t what is truly important, it\\'s only what the Electoral College does that makes a true impact on choosing of president for the next two years. It\\'s even stated in the very same article that, \"...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" If our vote truly matters then why not vote on keeping the Electoral College in play or getting rid of the flawed system once and for all.\\n\\nThe Electoral college is claimed to keep the voting system in line and prevent major mess, however this is not truly the case. There will still be flaws, but this is not the correct way to fix it. Listening strictly to the people\\'s vote is what Amercia was built on and as an American I would like to see a change and let my voice be heard. If I want to vote I will vote, I don\\'t want to vote on someone voting for me.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is unfair, unjust, and unamerican. The system takes away our right to vote for who we want not who we want to vote for us. If you are a true American you will understand why I know this is flawed. The Electoral College is not a proper way to handle our votes it must be a vote decided completely by the people of Amercia.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n\\nDear [Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the preservation of the Electoral College system in the election of the President of the United States, despite the calls for its abolition. The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, strikes a balance between election by Congress and election by popular vote, ensuring fair representation and protecting the interests of all states.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcomes. The possibility of dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is significantly lower than a dispute over the popular vote. The winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, due to the winner-take-all basis of awarding electoral votes. This system creates a clear victory and prevents elections from becoming uncertain and contentious.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College system ensures that every region is represented in the election process. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, necessitating candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This encourages candidates to campaign across various states, preventing them from focusing solely on regions where they are already popular. By requiring candidates to appeal to a diverse range of regions, the Electoral College guarantees that the President is perceived as representing the interests of the entire nation rather than just a particular region or group.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College system directs candidates to pay attention to swing states. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes motivates candidates to focus their campaign efforts on states that are closely contested. This means that voters in swing states receive greater attention from candidates, leading to more informed and thoughtful decision-making. Swing state voters, being crucial in determining the outcome, are more likely to engage in the political process and make well-informed choices.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College ensures that large states are not disadvantaged in the election process due to the apportionment of the Senate. The Electoral College grants more weight to large states, as they have a larger number of electoral votes. This balance helps in offsetting the influence of small states, ensuring that presidential campaigns are not exclusively focused on states with larger populations. By providing a balanced distribution of attention, the Electoral College system promotes the interests of all states, regardless of their size.\\n\\nFinally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. This reduces the complexity and costs associated with run-off elections, allowing for a more efficient and decisive outcome. The Electoral College serves as a safeguard against prolonged election cycles without compromising the democratic nature of the process.\\n\\nWhile critics argue that the Electoral College system is unfair and outdated, I contend that it ensures fair representation, guarantees certainty of outcomes, encourages trans-regional appeal, protects swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. Preserving the Electoral College is essential in upholding democratic principles and protecting the interests of all states.\\n\\nThank you for considering my viewpoint. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the Electoral College system when making decisions that will impact our nation\\'s electoral process.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]There are different advantages that come with limiting car usage. An example of an advantage of limiting car usage would be that there is less pollution in the atmosphere making the air cleaner to breath. If there continues to be massive car usage, especially in Beijing, China, there will be more smog in the air which is caused by car pollution.\\n\\nAlthough you may love your car, there will always be something good that will come out of parting ways with it. According to the article, Paris bans driving due to smog, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog... The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\" This shows that if you limit car usage, there will be less traffic in the road. With this being said, you will be able to move around freely without having to worry about massive amounts of cars, and also that there becomes less smog in the area meaning there is less pollution that was occurring. Also, the article, Carfree day in spinning into a big hit in Bogota stated that, \"BOGOTA, ColombiaIn a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.\" This describes that with the limiting of car usage, there is less commotion that will occur in the streets. Since the streets became less busy, you didn\\'t have to worry as much about the cars around you. With limited car usage, the world can become a much cleaner place than it once was because the amount of pollution can be decreased from our atmosphere.\\n\\nPeople think that there can never be any possible advantages towards limiting amounts of car usage when in fact there is. As stated in, Carfree day in spinning into a big hit in Bogota, \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" This quote describes basically that with the limited car usage, many things such as sidewalks have been renovated which actually makes people want to use them. With the multiple parks and sports centers that have bloomed, this will cause people to want to excersise and will help them continue not to want to drive their cars but to just ride their bikes or maybe even skateboards along the nice smooth sidewalks. According to the article, The End of Car Culture, \"They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends.\" An advantage that this quote shows is that, the two boys don\\'t mind not having a car because they can carpool with friends giving them more time to hang out. This also shows that percentages have been dropping with teenagers who want to get their license because as I already said, they want to hang out with friends. With all this information that has been given so far, you can see that there are, in fact, advantages towards limiting car usage.\\n\\nOverall, by limiting car usage, you will find a variety of advantages. Some of these advantages include that there is less pollution in the sky which is good since pollution causes large masses or smog, streets become less busy which means less traffic, people can get more excersise, and teenagers are not wanting to get their license so they actually have an excuse to hang out with friends since they will be carpooling. By limiting car usage, there will be less pollution in the air maybe being able to extend the life of humans since we will be breathing in cleaner air than we have in the past. So, by stating all this information, you can probably tell that there are plenty of advantages that come with limiting car usage.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and an advocate for the democratic process, I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College for the election of the President of the United States. While some may argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital and fair representation of our diverse nation, ensuring that every region has a voice in the presidential election.\\n\\nOne of the primary benefits of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the outcome of a presidential election. Unlike a popular vote system, where disputes over the results can occur, the Electoral College allows for a clear winner to emerge. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out in \"In Defense of the Electoral College,\" the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This structure provides stability and prevents prolonged disputes over election outcomes.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College promotes national unity by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. With the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes, no single region can dominate the election process. As Judge Posner suggests, this ensures that the president has broader support and is not merely a representative of one particular region. It encourages candidates to campaign in all areas of the country, ensuring that they understand and address the diverse needs of different regions.\\n\\nIn addition, the Electoral College helps to highlight the significance of swing states. These states, where the outcome is often uncertain, receive more attention from candidates and campaigns. By focusing on these states, candidates are forced to engage with voters and address their concerns, leading to a more informed electorate. This method allows for the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from candidates, to influence the final outcome, as pointed out by Judge Posner.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also ensures that large states have their fair share of attention from candidates. As Judge Posner argues, the mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution reduces the weight of large states. However, with the Electoral College, large states like Florida can still command significant attention from presidential candidates. This balance between large and small states is crucial in maintaining fairness and representation in our election process.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College system eliminates the need for run-off elections. By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes, it guarantees that a clear winner emerges. This avoids the complications and expenses associated with run-off elections, allowing for a more streamlined election process.\\n\\nWhile some may argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is the most effective and fair method for electing the President. It ensures stability, balances regional interests, highlights swing states, provides attention to large states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. Abolishing the Electoral College, as argued by Bradford Plumer in \"The Indefensible Electoral College,\" may lead to a concentrated focus on highly populated areas, while neglecting the needs and concerns of other areas of the country.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I urge you to consider the significant benefits of the Electoral College and to support its continuation. The Electoral College serves as a crucial safeguard to protect the representation and voices of all regions in our great nation. By maintaining this system, we can uphold the democratic principles upon which our country was built.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider my views and make the best decision for our nation.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name][Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n\\nSubject: A Case for the Electoral College\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator\\'s Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College system in electing the President of the United States. The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers as a compromise between a popular vote and a vote in Congress, serves an essential purpose in maintaining the fairness and integrity of our democratic process.\\n\\nOne of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. In the event of a dispute over the election results, the electoral vote winner has always exceeded the popular vote winner, ensuring a clear victor. This reduces the likelihood of prolonged disputes and allows for a smooth transition of power. In contrast, a direct popular vote system may lead to an increase in disputes, as the winner would only need a slight plurality of votes to claim victory.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College ensures that every region in our country has a voice and enables candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Without this system, a candidate with strong regional support would have no incentive to campaign in other regions, leading to a fragmented nation and a president who does not represent the interests of all Americans. By requiring presidential candidates to have support across multiple regions, the Electoral College promotes national unity and inclusivity.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states. This ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns and needs of these states, where decisions on the outcome of the election are often made. Voters in swing states receive more attention and information from the candidates, allowing them to make more informed decisions. This promotes voter engagement and thoughtful decision-making, resulting in a higher-quality election process.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also balances the political weight of big and small states. While the House of Representatives is designed to provide proportional representation based on population, the Electoral College guarantees that smaller states have a voice in the election process. This prevents larger states from dominating the presidential election and allows for a more equitable representation of all states.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures the selection of a clear winner. This simplifies the election process and avoids the complications and costs associated with run-off elections.\\n\\nCritics argue that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated. However, the fact that both conservative and liberal voices have supported its abolition speaks to its non-partisan nature. The system has proven to be effective for over two centuries and has only failed to align with the popular vote a handful of times. This demonstrates the system\\'s overall accuracy and reliability.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic process. It guarantees a certain outcome, encourages broad appeal by candidates, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, provides a balance between big and small states, and avoids the necessity of run-off elections. I urge you, Senator, to consider these reasons when discussing the future of our presidential election process.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that you will continue to support the Electoral College, as it upholds the principles of fairness, accountability, and representation that our country was founded on.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Everyone today believes that having a car is the best thing for them. Truthfully, it is not. Not having a car can prevent from polluting the earth and benefit us as people in a much better way. Not having a car will stop accidents, prevent deaths, and save you money.\\n\\nIn Vauban, many families now do not own cars. Heidrum Walter states \"When i had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" Not having a car could actually make you a much happier person as well. You would\\'nt have to worry about spending too much money on gas or even getting into accidents. If you have to go somewhere far, you can just hop on a subway or pay for a taxi. I know, your probaly thinking: Paying for a taxi or paying for a subway ticket cost money but definitely not nearly as much as having a car.\\n\\nNext, without having to drive cars, our air we breath in will be much less polluted then it would be with cars. Paris eventually ended up on banning driving because the smog was so harsh to the environment. Anyone who drove cars were then fined. According to the article \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France.\" Congestion is car traffic so therefore, there was less smog in the air. In the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota , it states \"It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines.\" Anyone who violated the rule was then fined a specific amount to stop the people from driving cars. Businessesman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated that \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take stress and lower air polution.\" Not owning a car can help you and your family become closer because you will have to walk places together, it will help you stay fit and it will benefit the companies because they will start to boom. In source 4, Michael Sivak says \"What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn.\" This means that more families are getting rid of their cars then they ever have before which will make the families closer. Walking everywhere will help you stay fit because your walking not sitting. Last but not least, companies will begin to boom. Source 3 states that \"uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks: rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic: and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" They are trying everything they can to make this world a better place. They are redoing a bunch of stuff just to show that they care. So lets show them that we care about our world too.\\n\\nSo lets think about the benefits of not having a car. You will be less stressed, you\\'ll be in less accidents and you will save money. If I could have that decision I totally would take it. It is benifical for all of us so lets just live life healthy.Dear Senator, I feel the need to eliminate the Electoral College process of voting and just have a regular election where the President with the most votes wins, as simple as that. Each vote counts as one, and there will be more or less votes depending on the state and its size and population.\\n\\nJust like Source 2, I feel \"The electorsal College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. \" \"Abolish the electorsal college!\". When you vote, you vote for \"a slate of electorss, who in turn elect the President\" Source 2, Paragraph 2. Why can\\'t it just be a regular election where you either bubble your democrat or republican representative instead of being so complicated and misleading. This can get people confused, and get them to vote for the wrong candidate without them even realizing! \"Do voters sometimes get confused about the electorss and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.\" Source 2, Paragraph 2. In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn\\'t even get to see the candidates in a campaign ads they focus on the \"bigger\" and more important swingstates to win. Each person should count as one, and each state should be as important as the other, just varying in the number of voters they had.\\n\\nIn Source 1, it says how \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electorss, the meeting of the electorss where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electorsal votes by Congress.\" You\\'re electing electorss instead of just who you want for President. To top it off, you can\\'t even control who your electorss vote for! So people can vote for an electors thinking that he\\'s going to vote for the Republican party but then he votes for the Democratic party. This process can be very misleading. \"Can voters control whom their electorss vote for? Not always.\". The disaster factor as mentioned in Source 2 could aways occur.\\n\\nSome counterarguments might include the certainty of outcome, and how the Electoral Vote might be greater than the Popular Vote. But at the end of the day, the people are nominating their president, they don\\'t want others to do it for them. The Popular Vote representing our country as a whole with all individual votes added up should be the deciding factor. A tie is almost impossible in that circumstance also, because what are the chances out of millions of citizens the number would be perfectly split in half. If a president appeals for a region, then let them vote for who they believe is the better candidate. At the end of the day, the majority wins. Swing states won\\'t have to be a factor without the Electoral College, and big states are just counted them same, one point per vote. Runoff elections won\\'t be necessary if the highest percentage president wins, even if its not majority.\\n\\nSo, hopefully you see my view on this issue and the Electoral College can be eliminated.Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the selection of the President of the United States. While it is understood that there are arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should be taken into consideration.\\n\\nOne of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As the system currently stands, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the potential for disputed elections is significantly reduced. In contrast, a direct popular vote system would likely result in more disputes over the outcome, as any slight shift in the popular vote could have a significant impact. This stability and certainty are crucial in ensuring that our democratic process is respected and can move forward efficiently.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College requires presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must appeal to a broader range of voters. This is important because it ensures that the president represents the entire nation, not just a specific region. It fosters national unity and prevents the marginalization of certain areas or interests. Under a popular vote system, candidates would have less incentive to campaign in regions that they know they cannot win, which could lead to a feeling of disenfranchisement among voters in those areas.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states or toss-up states. These states are typically more representative of the entire nation and are likely to have a more thoughtful and engaged electorate. By prioritizing these states, candidates are forced to listen to and address the concerns of a wider range of voters. This ensures that the election is decided by the most informed and engaged citizens, leading to a more representative outcome.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College helps balance the political influence of large and small states. Large states have more electoral votes and therefore receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This is important in offsetting the disproportionate power held by small states due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By giving larger states more weight in the election process, the Electoral College ensures that their voices are heard and their interests are taken into account.\\n\\nFinally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In the event that no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College guarantees a clear winner. This avoids the complications and logistical challenges that come with run-off elections. It also prevents situations where a candidate with a small plurality of the popular vote could win the election, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the presidency.\\n\\nWhile it is true that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, it is important to remember that the majority of voters in presidential elections are motivated by the desire to express their political preferences. The impact of a single vote in a national election is limited, yet millions of Americans still cast their votes because they believe in the democratic process and want their voice to be heard.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College provides stability, regional representation, thoughtful decision-making, balance between large and small states, and a clear winner. It may have its flaws, but it is a system that has proven effective in ensuring the fair and representative selection of the President. I urge you to consider these advantages and support the retention of the Electoral College.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your Name]The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming more apparent as cities around the world experiment with car-free zones and car-reduced communities. These initiatives aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote alternative modes of transportation. By limiting car usage, cities can become more compact and accessible, with less space dedicated to parking. This shift towards \"smart planning\" can have numerous benefits for both individuals and the environment.\\n\\nOne example of a car-free community is Vauban in Germany. In Vauban, residents are not allowed to have street parking, driveways, or home garages. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. The absence of cars has created a more relaxed atmosphere, with verdant streets filled with pedestrians and bicycles. This shows that limiting car usage can lead to a happier and more enjoyable living environment.\\n\\nThe impact of cars on the environment is a major concern. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. By limiting car usage, particularly in suburbs where cars are heavily relied upon, it is possible to significantly reduce these emissions. This is crucial in the fight against climate change and promoting a sustainable future.\\n\\nIn addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage also has other positive effects. It can decrease traffic congestion, improve air quality, and make cities more walkable and bike-friendly. For example, after a partial driving ban in Paris to combat smog, congestion in the city was reduced by 60 percent. This shows that by reducing car usage, cities can become more efficient and livable.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can encourage the use of public transportation and other alternative modes of transportation. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work, resulting in eerily traffic-free streets. This initiative not only reduced pollution but also showcased the potential for alternative transportation to be successful.\\n\\nThe trend of limiting car usage is not exclusive to specific countries or regions. In the United States, there has been a decrease in car ownership, with Americans driving fewer miles and getting fewer licenses. This shift in behavior has been attributed to various factors, including the availability of telecommuting, the renewal of center cities, and the rise of car-sharing programs. This cultural shift towards reducing car usage is beneficial for the environment, as transportation is a significant source of carbon emissions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, decrease traffic congestion, and promote alternative modes of transportation. Initiatives such as car-free zones and car-reduced communities are being implemented in various cities around the world, demonstrating the potential for a future with reduced car reliance.I think that we should change from the Electoral College, to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Yes, the electoral College in good in some ways, but I believe the flaws it has out numbers the good things. When you vote you really aren\\'t voting for the president but for a slate of electors, there was the 2000 fiasco, and there really isn\\'t that many reasons to keep the current method of choosing our president.\\n\\nAccording to the article \"What is Electoral College?\" The electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress. So you really are\\'nt voting for the president but for a slate of electors. electors can be anyone isn\\'t holding a public office. Who is picked as the electors depends on the state. Sometimes there\\'s state conventions, sometimes the state party\\'s central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Voters can\\'t control who the electors vote for and sometimes voters get confused about electors and vote for the wrong candidate.\\n\\nThere was also the 2000 fiasco that was the biggest election crisis in a century, and the system allows for much worse, according to \"The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong.\" There have been a few occasions where \"faithless\" electors have refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and casted the deciding vote for whomever they pleased. Oh, and what happens if a state sends two state electors to Congress? According to \"The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" it happened it hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richar Nixon, validated only his opponent\\'s electors, but he made sure to do so \"without establishing a precedent.\" But who\\'s to say it won\\'t happen again?\\n\\nThe Electoral College does have some goods things about it as well. It states those things in the article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President.\" 1. There is always a Certainty of Outcome \"A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. 2. It makes it Everyone\\'s President.\"The electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.\" Which means no regions has enogh elecotrol votes to elect a president. 3. Swing states, \"the winnertakeall method of awarding elecotral votes includes the candidates to focus their campaigns efforts on the tossup states.\" 4. Big States, \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the senate decreed in the Constitution\" 5. It avoids runoff Elections, \"Electoral College avoids the problem of electionsin which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.\" Now, you can see why I think we should change from the College Electoral to election by Popular Vote. The Electoral Vote does have it\\'s advantages but I think the many disadvantages that come with it outweigh those advantages.\\n\\nWhen you vote you really aren\\'t voting for the president but for a slate of electors, there was the 2000 fiasco, and there really isn\\'t that many reasons to keep the current method of choosing our president.Dear Senator, I believe that the United States deserves someone who will lead this country to do the right thing, to make independent choices, and to be the best version of ourselves we can be every day. Now, how do we know when choosing a leader to represent us if thats what we will achieve when voting? We don\\'t for sure, but we can make judgements and calls that will give us a better understanding to whom we are choosing. One of the biggest fought over rights was the right to vote, in which everyone wanted. Now that we have that vote, we should be able to use that freedom and have a say in who we want to represent us. Therefore, I think we should change the election to popular vote for the President of the United States rather than relying on the Electoral College.\\n\\nThe Electoral college consists of 538 Electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate\\'s political party and given their own says and responsibilities. That being said, I think that getting rid of the Electoral College will eliminate all biased decisions and will create more freedom and responsibilities for the people of the U.S. to use their own judgement and choose who they think will best represent the country. Being in the electoral college and being selected to have a heavy say in who will be chosen is a big responsibilty and in that responsibility are duties to not only look at each candidate with one mind set and one point of view but to make an unbiased judgement. To make an unbiased call would mean to put away all your own thoughts and judgements and really get a good understanding of who the people truly need. Back in 1960, it states that segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. How can we tell that something like this will not happen again? Well if we choose to keep the Electoral College it very well could and the people of the country would not be making decisions for themselves as well.\\n\\nMost worrying comes from the fear of a tie, in which the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one single vote. That single vote from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters could have as much say as the 55 representatives from California who represent 35 million voters. So therefore the election is really only a few swing voters away from a disaster. Because of the winnertakeall system, candidates really dont spend time campaigning in states they think they have no chance of winning, really only focusing on the bigger states with more votes. This is also unfair because then the people with the right to vote do not get a say in who they want to represent their country. The Electoral college really takes away many rights and freedoms to the people of the U.S. and doesnt give us the chance to have a say. Studies even show that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now!\\n\\nAs well as having such a biased voting system, this is such an unfair system due to the fact the the popular vote winner could loose because of the Electoral College voters. This would be a very bad decision to keep the Electoral College especially if these Electoral voters have had their decision swayed by something. Then we will have a president that is only the president because of some voters biased and unfair judgemented calls. If one Electoral College voter has a certain view on a candidate, they could very well share that and somehow persuade the other voters decisions due to one persons thoughts and points of view on the candidate. One person can easily influence many peoples own judgements, which would cause them to choose poorly and only go under the pressure of that persons thoughts. The Electoral College has so many cons which would make it such a bad decision to keep this system and go by a biased and unfair advantage. So I believe that the best thing for the U.S. voting system would be to abolish the Electoral College and to keep the popular vote system so that everyone has their own say on who will achieve great things for our country.Dear Rick Scott, Every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, the Electoral College casts their votes to elect the new President of the United States of America. These voters are chosen by the citizens of their state Florida, Texas, etc. to vote in their favor of their preferred party. For example, a Democratic voter in California will vote for Democratic Electoral College candidates to vote for their preferred President. Though many people are opposed to this method of voting, calling it an anachronism & taking away the vote from the citizens of the United States, American citizen\\'s votes still count, the Electoral College can avoid problems popular voting could result in, and the Electoral College listens to those with the initiative and right to make a smart vote. For these reasons I would like to keep the Electoral College.\\n\\nThe Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between election of the President by a vote of Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, meaning one vote almost relies on the other. A common misconception made by citizens is that when they vote they vote for a President, when in fact they are voting for people to vote in their favor for the President. So the more Republican Electoral College voters your state has, most likely the end vote will be the electoral votes go to the Republican candidate. Many people say that the electoral college \"takes away the votes of the citizens, and that their vote doesn\\'t matter\" when in reality, they matter in every way possible. If the citizens do not vote, who will vote for the electoral college members? And without the citizens to decide who the members of the Electoral College will be, who will be in the Electoral College all together?\\n\\nNot only do the Citizen\\'s votes count, but the Electoral College can help solve the problems that a popular voting system could have. The Electoral College votes with the majority of the state, meaning that the party with the highest request for its Presidency, the Electoral College will cast its votes towards. Meaning a highly Democratic state can count on their state\\'s vote to most likely be for the Democratic candidate. The Electoral College also avoids runoff elections. This means that the election will always show a clear winner for the state\\'s vote. There is a lot of potential pressure for a runoff election when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cats that pressure could greatly affect the Presidential election process, which the Electoral College reduces, ultimately showing a clear winner.\\n\\nAnd finally, the Electoral College listens to smart and eligible voters. Very rarely does a State\\'s Electoral College vote against the wishes of their citizens. In fact that would be the exact opposite of their job. It\\'s also an inetible fact that not every voter is an ideal voter. Many citizens do not keep themselves up to date on the issues candidates plan to solve, occupation backgrounds, or even their personality. Many voters in fact vote on astetics, which is ultimately the most dangerous voter there is an uner educated one.\\n\\nSo Mr. Scott, I hope you take into account that an in terms of an electoral college, an American citizen\\'s vote does count, they avoid the problems popular votes could create, and they do listen to their state\\'s smart, eligable voters. If the Founding Fathers created this tool for the balance in our voting system, then balance there shall be.Senator [Senator\\'s Full Name],\\n\\nI am writing to you today as an engaged and concerned student, who is well invested in the democratic principles that have been core to the American political system since its inception. Given the recent debates about the continued efficacy of the Electoral College, it is crucial to thoroughly consider both sides of the argument before making any sweeping changes to our system. I believe that while the Electoral College has some inherent flaws, it nonetheless offers a number of advantages in terms of preserving regional balance, ensuring certainty of outcome and avoiding the complexities of electoral run-offs.\\n\\nLet\\'s accept the truth, the Electoral College unquestionably lacks modern democratic appeal wherein each vote receives equal weightage (1, 15). While each citizen\\'s vote counts, this process sees to the election of the president by a select group of electors rather than the popular majority itself (2, 15). Despite the stark anti-democratic aspect, the revolution in favor of a popular vote scale bears its own array of inherent risks and complications.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College ensures a definitive and uncomplicated conclusion to the election (18). As Judge Richard Posner states, electoral disputes like back in 2000 were mitigated due to the clarity of the Electoral College system (18). This stands in contrast to the potential confusion a direct election might cause when no candidate receives a clear majority of popular votes. This then calls for the implementation of a complex and time-consuming run-off election (22). Therefore, adherents argue that the Electoral College continues to simplify the process and assure certainty of outcome due to this winner-take-all strategy (18).\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College mandates that a presidential candidate garners support from a diverse range of regions for a win, thus ensuring a representative with a broader national appeal, unlike a candidate with regional appeal who could potentially win a majority in a popular vote system (19). It balances out the largely varied regional powers by demanding attention from candidates to states with diverse political leanings which could otherwise be neglected (21). Ultimately, it safeguards our system from the tyranny of a regional majority.\\n\\nHowever, it bears acknowledging that the existing system bears genuine concerns including the possibility of faithless electors, prospect of an electoral tie, and situations where a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the presidency due to the Electoral College (11, 12, 16). Such circumstances indeed taint the integrity of the electoral system and understate the democratic principle of representing voters.\\n\\nGiven our constitutional responsibility, potential systemic changes cannot be ignored. However, it\\'s equally important to consider the nuances and rationale behind the Electoral College. What we need is not a swift dismissal of the Electoral College, but thoughtful evaluation and possible reforms to better represent the popular sentiment while retaining the checks and balances it offers.\\n\\nThank you for your time. I trust you will consider these perspectives before forming a stand on this important matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your Full Name]Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. The passage set provides examples from various parts of the world that demonstrate the positive impact of reducing reliance on cars.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can go up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, these emissions can be significantly reduced. Vauban, a town in Germany, serves as an excellent example of this. With the majority of families not owning cars, the streets are car-free, resulting in a substantial decrease in emissions. Similarly, in Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog caused by car emissions. As a result, congestion in the city was reduced by 60 percent.\\n\\nLimiting car usage also has health benefits. Cars contribute to air pollution, which can have adverse effects on human health. The smog in Paris, for instance, rivaled that of heavily polluted cities like Beijing. By reducing car usage, the air quality improves, reducing respiratory problems and other health issues. Bogota in Colombia implemented a car-free day to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event has been successful in changing people\\'s behavior and has been replicated in other cities as well.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the opportunity for more compact and accessible communities. Traditionally, suburbs have been designed around car use, which has led to increased traffic congestion and sprawling developments. However, efforts are being made to create suburban areas that prioritize public transportation and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Vauban in Germany is a prime example of this approach, where stores are located within walking distance on a main street, reducing the need for long car journeys to shopping malls.\\n\\nReducing car usage can also have economic benefits. Delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban, highlighting the reliance on cars for certain businesses. However, by shifting to alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or public transportation, individuals can save money on fuel and car maintenance costs.\\n\\nOverall, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages, from reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more accessible communities and promoting healthier lifestyles. While the transition may require changes in infrastructure and individual habits, the benefits to both individuals and the environment make it a worthwhile endeavor.Dear Senator,\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to you today to address what has become an imperative question for a democratic society like ours - Should we keep the Electoral College or switch to the popular vote for selecting the President of the United States? \\n\\nOur Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between having Congress and the masses choose the President (Office of the Federal Register). However, criticizers of the system, like Bradford Plumer, argue that the system is old and arbitrary (The Indefensible Electoral College). Others, like Judge Richard A. Posner, defend the system for its carefully laid principles and practicality (In Defense of the Electoral College). \\n\\nOpponents claim that the Electoral College rejects the democratic principle of one man, one vote, and has continually posed threats of disaster factor like the debacle of 2000, where the person with a higher vote count did not end up as the President, and scenarios where electors may not vote for whom they pledged (The Indefensible Electoral College). However, if we critically view our political system, calling for a direct democracy may not be the optimal solution either.\\n\\nThe Electoral College presents a more balanced method as it gives leverage to smaller states. The system demands national appeal from a candidate rather than just targeted campaigning (In Defense of the Electoral College). Under a popular vote, candidates might only campaign in highly populated regions, often neglecting the interest of voters in less populated areas, diminishing the essence of representation that lies at the core of democracy. \\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcomes and prevents complicated situations such as the run-off elections, as Judge Posner rightly pointed out (In Defense of the Electoral College). Simply shifting to popular vote without acknowledging this issue could lead to more complications.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s clear that the system has its concerns, it\\'s crucial to remember that our present democratic process was established over hundreds of years. If popular vote is viewed as a more democratic approach, perhaps we could consider reformations of the current system rather than a complete overhaul. A system where electors are allocated proportionally in each state, akin to Maine and Nebraska’s “proportional representation,” could be an intermediate solution to reconcile the critics of the Electoral College while still keeping some safeguards of the current system intact (Office of the Federal Register).\\n\\nOur nation is built on democratic ideals, and any changes must be well-thought-out and presented to the citizens for discussion. Ultimately, it should be our shared ambition to make every vote count and the presidential election process more equitable and transparent.\\n\\nThank you for considering my view on this matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name][Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[State Senator\\'s Name]\\n[State Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, Zip Code]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections\\n\\nDear Senator [Last Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the benefits it provides in our presidential election process. While some argue for a switch to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College better serves our democratic principles and safeguards against potential issues that may arise with a direct election.\\n\\nOne of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure certainty of outcomes. With the winner-takes-all system in place, the winning candidate\\'s share of the electoral votes often exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the results of the election are less likely to be disputed compared to a purely popular vote system, as witnessed in the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College minimizes the chances of a nationwide tie, which would require a run-off election and complicate the process.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region in our country has a voice in the election. In a direct popular vote system, candidates would primarily focus on densely populated urban areas, neglecting the concerns and interests of less populated rural areas. By requiring candidates to appeal to different regions, the Electoral College promotes a more balanced representation and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president. This ensures that the elected president is \"everyone\\'s president,\" taking into account the diverse needs and interests of the entire nation.\\n\\nThe swing state phenomenon also highlights the significance of the Electoral College. In a popular vote system, candidates would predominantly concentrate on large population states, disregarding the concerns and perspectives of smaller states. The winner-takes-all method employed by the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states where the election outcome is uncertain. This encourages candidates to engage with voters from a variety of states and ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who are eager to listen and consider different perspectives, play a decisive role in determining the election outcome.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College preserves the political balance for larger states. The apportionment of Senate seats grants small states a proportionally larger influence than their population size would warrant, compensating for the potential imbalance caused. The Electoral College further accentuates this balance, as larger states receive more attention from candidates, both in terms of campaigning and addressing regional issues. This ensures that the presidential election process accommodates the interests and concerns of both small and large states, promoting a fair and equal representation.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. By avoiding run-off elections, the process remains streamlined and preserves the stability and effectiveness of our democratic system.\\n\\nWhile some argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states dominated by one party, leading to voter apathy, it is essential to note that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences. Additionally, the Electoral College reduces the likelihood of contested elections and guarantees that voters\\' voices are respected, irrespective of the state\\'s political leanings.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in ensuring certainty of outcomes, promoting regional representation, encouraging candidates to engage with swing states, maintaining political balance, and avoiding run-off elections. It fosters a fair and democratic election process that takes into account the diverse needs and interests of our nation. I respectfully urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College and to support its continuation in our presidential elections.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]Can you tell the air feels different? Over the past years some countries have put restrictions on car usage. Although this may sound extremely crazy to some, most individuals accept the new law\\'s for car\\'s. Motorized vehicles have put a toll on our environment, our well being, and our wallets. By certain countries banning the use of motorized vehicles it has allowed individuals stress level to decrease, lowered air pollution, and increase money that citizens have. Gas cars that create pollution are a thing of the past, we are moving to electric cars, bicycles, and more the future is changing and its for our own benefits.\\n\\nCars are one of the main sources for people\\'s stress, whether it be because of car failures, others who annoy you while you drive, or the fact you can never find a parking spot. Heidrun Walter claims \" When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way In German suburb, Life goes on without Cars 3.\" One main reason people are less tense and stress is because people do not have to constantly worry about if another car is about to hit them, if traffic is going to be to slow to get to work, or if your car is going to breakdown on you. Car\\'s create unwanted stress that can be easily avoided. Indeed life would be very different without cars people in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have all been able to function properly without motorized vehicles. In fact \"70 percent of vaughn\\'s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold cars to move her In German Suburbs, Life goes on without Cars 3.\" These individuals have proven that it is okay to make a switch. In order for you to reduce stress in your life, you have to take away the source of stress, and that is what citizens have done, and without cars majority of people are happier and healthier.\\n\\nDue to citizen\\'s of Bogota, Paris, and Germany not using cars and having to switch to bikes, walking, and electric bikes has greatly reduced toxic gases in the environment. Due to individuals in Paris not excessively using cars the amount of smog has reduced. According to Robert Duffer \" after days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city Paris bans driving due to smog 10.\" Paris has enforced strict rules that rejects people from driving, also a switch to diesel fuels. In return these ideas have lowered the level of smog in Paris creating a cleaner environment for the citizen. Not only has Paris help reduce toxic gases from entering our environment, but so has Bogota. In the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky stated that this has been Bogota\\'s \"thrid year straight that cars have been banned for one day\" and the only motorized vehicles they have used are \"buses\". This switched has dramatically cut traffic, rush hour, and the amount of smog left in the air. Although there is still traces of pollution after this day it has lowered. The reasons are simple, using less cars makes less gases, also those who go the day without using cars may like the change better and permantely switch to a lifestyle without cars.\\n\\nAnother thing that has been changed due to the limitation of car usages is that with individuals not having to buy a car, pay for insurance, and pay for gas, it has increased the amount of money citizens have in their wallets. Citizens of the United States of America have not exactly chosen to not use cars, but some have, the main reason Citizen of America have limited themself is due to a lack of money. During our \"recession\" Americans were \"unemployed\" and \"unable to pay The end of car culture 32.\" Because citizens were not able to pay for cars, they did not use them, thus as you get adapted to a new situation you tend to stay with it. After the switch citizens who chose to continue a life without a car, were able to have more money because they didnt have to pay for the cost that come with a car. Now some citizens have made the switch to not using motorized vehicles, which has helped increase the amount of money citizens have, which is always an advantage because you are able to pay for other things that are neccasary to your life.\\n\\nAlthough cars seem like a material object that is so precious to life, it\\'s not. In all reality people can live a life without cars, citizens in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have, and they enjoy it. Its time to make a switch and make a helpful change in your lifestyle. A life without cars is very benefitial, it is less stressful, lowers pollution, and has an increases of money. Although not using cars is a bit extreme, you can always make a better switch to using electric products, which can also help lower the amount of toxic gases in the air. Gas car\\'s that produce extreme levels of gases are a thing of the past, I believe its time to move to the future.I think people should stop relying on their cars so much for three reasons. I hope this can change peoples minds about using the vehicles for everything. Even going to the corner of their block just for a bite they use their cars.\\n\\nThe opening reason why I think people should really limit their car usage is that it causes less pollution in the atmosphere. If drives don\\'t give a limit to their uses of their cars we might end up having global warming. That\\'s not gonna be great. For example before when cars were rarely seen we had no global warming problem, but now that cars are seen all over the places, global warming is near of arrival.\\n\\nThe following reason why I think people should put a limit to their car usage is that it would benefit everyone because there will be less traffic. Having no traffic at all is a common dream for many drivers that drive to work using the expressway every morning. unfortunately people have to be stuck in traffic everyday because they don\\'t want to let go of their cars. They should experiment other ways to get to work or to even the corner of their block. They should try bike riding to their destations. That\\'s double the benefit. They get to exercise their bodies and not damage the environment with deadly gases that can cause global warming. In the second source by Robert Duffer he states that \"congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France\".\\n\\nMy next reason why I think drivers should limit their car uses is because they are basically killing themselves with fatal accidents almost everyday. There\\'s a lot of causes for fatal accidents, one of them is texting and driving. That\\'s the main cause of fatal car accidents. Drunk driving is at close second. None the less, if people would just pay attention while they are driving there would be less car accidents, or even better they stop using their cars as often to avoid car accidents. Even when knowone is distracted while driving there are still a few car accidents. Most of the time that\\'s just a regular accident with knowone losing their lives, but it happens many tims because the streets are so compacted with drivers eager to move. That\\'s why I think people should stop relying on their cars so heavily. To decrease the death rate to a normal level.\\n\\nIn conclusion, all these three reasons why I think people should limit the usage of their vehicles are the reasons why the world isn\\'t at it\\'s normal levels of natural events in traffic. If citizens would rely less on their vehicles, we would see a change in the air we breathe and less chances of having global warming, less traffic in city streets, and less fatal car accidents with less people being killed.The process of the electing the president is a topic commonly debated upon. This topic must be carefully examined because the President of the United States plays a major role in leading our country and must be chosen with care. The two ways of electing our president is by the Electoral College which dates back to the founding fathers, or by the popular vote which is a more modern process. The question is, should the electoral college remain the current voting process or should we change to electing the president of the United States through popular votes? Whether you are in favor of the Electoral College or against it there are consequences to both sides. Presidential election through popular votes may have disadvantages, yet the Electoral College must be changed because voters are not in complete control and reduce the probability of an electoral tie.\\n\\nTo begin, according to Richard A. Posner the Electoral College is a fair accurate way to elect the president. The Electoral College requires the candidates to have a multiregional appeal and allows the most thoughtful voters to decide the election unlike the popular vote. Richard A. Posner notes in his article that the Electoral College avoids a candidate that is a regional favorite to gain votes and win. The Electoral College requires the candidates to have a \"transregional appeal\" Posner. If we used a process that allowed a candidate with only regional appeal to be elected as President this would increase the chances of electing an ineffective, successful president. Additionally, the Electoral College allows only the most thoughtful voters to decide who becomes President Posner. candidates will be chosen more carefully and thoughtfully. These voters will have gained the most accurate information and apply this to their choice. Thus, the Electoral College has some beneficial outcomes, but the popular vote is a better choice for our system of choosing the President.\\n\\nFirst of all, changing to electing through popular votes could fix the problem of voters not having a big say in who become the President. In Bradford Plumer\\'s article he includes that voters can\\'t always \"control whom their electors vote for\". All of the residents of the United States who choose to participate in the presidential election should be able to have their voice heard individually. Voters should not have to rely on their state electors to choose the right president. Additionally, voters not being able to have their voice hears affects which candidate becomes elected. Sometimes the electors can go against the opinion of the people Plumer. Electors should not be the only ones that are allowed to have responsibilty in picking the President of the United States. Electors could totally \"defy the will of the people\" and it is unfair that they are responsible for the whole process of choosing the President of the United States. Thus, the popular vote is a better choice because the people of the United States should have a bigger say in their President.\\n\\nSecondly, changing the electoral college to popular vote could not only help voters have their voice heard but, it could also reduce the probability of a tie in the electoral vote.The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. It should be upheld for it\\'s ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it\\'s faults are not worse than the popular vote system, and that the Electoral College fosters a presidency campaign that appeals to multiple regions of the United States. This fair system allows representation of the people\\'s will, just like the rest of our government does.\\n\\nFaith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary. According to source one, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", each political party has it\\'s own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a \"winnertakeall\" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficial to the outcome of the election because it makes the ability for a candidate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president\", states that \"even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state...\" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.\\n\\nNo system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\", Source 2, argues that a term called disaster factor\\', or the possibility of imminent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished. The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in louisiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, \"faithless\" electoral voters would vote for the other side. These are starman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn\\'t perfect, neither is the popular vote system. The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn\\'t have a \"winnertakeall\" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, \"..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people..\", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress.\\n\\nIn addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate\\'s campaign. Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The \"winnertakeall\" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that \"The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests...\", and so having a transregional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.\\n\\nOur Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves.Dear Mr.Mrs. Senator, In light of previous research I\\'ve done on the Electoral College, I would like the opportunity to voice my opinion on how the voting system should work in this country. Based off of the information acquired and with the best interest of the country at heart, I believe that the system should be changed to the election by popular vote for the president of the United States.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, when voters vote, they aren\\'t really voting for their candidate, but a slate of electors, which in turn elect the president. Don\\'t you think that this method is a little impersonal? As well as the matter of possibly having one\\'s chosen candidate not win the presidencyeven when they\\'ve won the popular vote as a result of losing the electoral vote. According to the Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, the best argument against the electoral college is what we call the disaster factor. The system allows room for crisis technically state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, who could always defy the will of the people. An example, would be in 1960, when segregationists almost succeeded in replacing electors of the Democratic party with new ones who opposed John F. Kennedy as well as the case of some faithless electors refusing to vote for their party\\'s candidate and pick whomever they like.\\n\\nAnother valid reason as to why the system of voting must be changed to popular vote is due to the unfair winnertakesall way the electoral college works. In most cases, candidates do not see all states as important, only those they think they have a shot in winning over. A way to look at this, according to \\'In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing the presidents, is that a regional favorite, such as Mitt rodney in the South during the 2012 voting, has no incentive to campaign in states outside of the region because he gains no electoral votes. However, this is also a disadvantage, for he cannot expand his popularity to other regions of the country. If he does so with the new popular vote system, winning the presidency will be guaranteed. Neglecting voters that are potential supporters of one\\'s campaign is, in my opinion, the worst way to go about winning.\\n\\nIn summation, the Electoral College should be replaced with a popular voting system. I assure you that even though this system might have worked in the past, but in the ever changing world of politics, some things have to be done away with, and the Electoral College is one of them with holes in the way the system works and outcomes that could possibly do more harm than good leave the Electoral College with nothing more to offer the future of this country. Thank you for your time.\"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\" said Heidrun Walker, in \"carfree cities\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal. Currently in the United States, 82 percent of people own a vehicle. Which means in the average city is a busy street, car horns honking, triffic conjested place to live. Limiting car usage can be beneficial to you, your city, and your planet.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can have great advantages on the Earth. Almost half of the greenhouse gas in the united states is from cars. Greenhouse gas has an effect on the North and South Poles that makes them melt faster causing the sea level to rise. So, if we were to lessen the use of cars we would be doing a great favor to the Earth. Many times on the news we hear about oil spills, and big or small, it hurts so many sea animals because it gets in their fur and when prey wants to eat those contaminated animals they die. Think of all the innocent animals that get hurt so that cars have gas to run on.\\n\\nLiving in a carfree city can benefit the whole community. Knowing all or your neighbors is pretty rare now because everyone is always on the go driving somewhere, or cooped up in their home. Walking or Biking to the store with your neighbors can be the new normal if car usage was limited. Vehicles will actually hurt your health in the long run, because cars put so much pollution in the air which will eventually make the air too toxic to breathe. In, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" by robert Duffer, \"just one day with half of paris not driving the smog cleared enough that they didnt have to ban driving the next day\". According to the U.S. motor vehicle accident website, every ten minutes somebody dies in the United States due to a car accident. Loved ones can be saved if car usage is limited.\\n\\nReducing the usage of cars will benefit your well being. Driving a vehicle requires so much attention and focus, it is quite stressful. \"It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" said Carlos Arturo during Bogota, colombians carfree day. People of Vauban, Germany a city that gave up cars are happier, they have more energy, and they even look younger. Gas is at an everage price of two dollars and thirty cents, think of all the money that can be saved and put towards something else if you never had to pay for gas again! Limiting car usage will help you financially, physically, and mentally.\\n\\nOverall, a city without cars has many advantages. People can see the people they love and the planet they love prosper without the usage of vehicles. According to, \"The end of car culture\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, \"Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which, \\'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.Imagine the world in the future, completely full and covered with cars. Roads are going to start taking up every area of Earth, if people continue driving everywhere and buying cars. I think people should limit car usage because it\\'s environmental friendly, they\\'ll get more exercise, and people will be happier. Cars can be handy from time to time, but i think they should only be used occasionally. Imagine if there was a car for everyone on the planet. Car usage should decrease.\\n\\nFirst of all, the Earth is beautiful and the people on it need to take better care of it. For example, just one day without the use of cars in a city, allowed them to construct bike paths, new sidewalks, and reduced traffic jams. Fuel from cars will polute the air and cause smog. If everyone continues to use cars as much as they do or more, there will be no way to clean all the air. When Paris banned cars for a while, smog was cleared and reduced by a lot. Limiting car use will not save the Earth completely, but it will help very much.\\n\\nSecondly, if people started using cars less, they could get outside more and get more exercise. Biking will help people get fresh air and decrease pollution because cars won\\'t be used as much. People should start finding jobs or doing activities that are close enough to walk or bike to. Cars are for situations in which you really have no other way there or long distances. That\\'s all I think they should be used for. Everyone would be much more fit and healthy if it weren\\'t for being lazy and having to take a car there.\\n\\nLastly, not using cars could increase people\\'s happiness. Some people suggest that having a car makes them tense. Everyone would become much closer together and explore more of the world without cars. We could all be outdoors or around each other more. For example, you could take the bus to work instead of your car and meet a new friend. You never know what could happen when you try something new. It\\'s good to change things up once in a while, like not taking your car every now and then and finding another way there.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the positives definetely outnumber the negatives of limiting car use. The main three reasons in my opinion is that it\\'s environmental friendly, you\\'ll get more exercise, and you\\'ll most likely be much happier. Think about all the good outcomes that could come out of not driving your car and try it sometime.\" All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car...\" Now and days alot of countries are limiting car usage to go into a day of free car day, which basically means that no one is allowed to drive their motor running cars for a day. If they disobey the law they will be charge a fine. Its like a when a police officer stops you for passing a red light or for speeding on a no speeding zone. Still these countries are getting advantages over these days because there will be less smog, less traffic, and more people buying bicycles rather than a expensive car.\\n\\n\" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog.\" one of the advantages for limiting car use is there will be less smog to deal with in the air. this can harm not only us but our environment we live in, which is the air we breath. In france they decide to do a car ban day. The result of this event was that the \" Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions\". If someone was brave enough to drive a car than they will be fined 22euro which is 31.\\n\\n\" Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters, people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine\". Less traffic was on the streets due this ban of cars, which allowed the people with bicycles to go on the streets and ride them. In Bogota,Colombia they also did this ban but they gained more advantages over limiting car usage, only buses and taxis were permitted to drive on the streets. their goal was to promote alternative transportation. Due to this event, parks and sports centers were packed throughout the city, and pitted sidewalks have been replaced by smooth sidewalks for the skateboards and bikes.\\n\\n\" What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before downturn said Micheal siva\". As a result of car ban people have stop buying cars which is atrocious for car companies but at the same time there is a up side to this also and is that people will now walk or ride bicycles to get to where they need. Which also leads to people being more athletic and less people being obese or overweight.\\n\\nThese countries are gaining alot because of these car ban which is good for removing these dark clouds in the air, less traffic, and people riding bicycles rather than cars. Its obviusly that some people think that this rule is selfish or not needed but its helps more than you think it does. And some people are just mad because of what they are getting charged or fine for driving in the streets even though you can\\'t due to the law.Dear Senator (Senator\\'s Last name),\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my views regarding our nation\\'s electoral process, specifically, the debate around the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the presidential election. \\n\\nThe idea of one person, one vote, which is the essence of a democracy, may seem to lean the argument in favor of the popular vote. A direct vote would certainly address concerns raised by Mr. Bradford Plumer in his article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College.\" As he notes, the electoral system often compels presidential candidates to focus their campaigns on \"swing\" states, leaving voters in \"non-contesting\" states feeling ignored and marginalized. Moreover, the possibility of someone winning the popular vote but losing the election due to the Electoral College, as we saw in year 2000, further adds to these grievances.\\n\\nHowever, as Judge Richard A. Posner rightly pointed out in \"In Defense of the Electoral College,\" the Electoral College serves critical functions that are often overlooked. Firstly, this framework reduces chances of disputes over the popular vote by delivering generally decisive victories. Second, it necessitates that candidates have trans-regional appeal, discouraging the rise of regional parties having narrow perspectives. Furthermore, the Electoral College restores political balance among large and small states, mitigating the potential biases of a purely population-based vote.\\n\\nEssentially, while the popular vote offers a simplified democratic process, the Electoral College serves as a complex balance of popular and federal interest, molded by the founding fathers to maintain a balance of power across states and regions. Therefore, despite its apparent flaws, our discussion should be focused on improving and refining the Electoral College instead of abolishing it.\\n\\nOne modification can be limiting the power of \"faithless\" electors to preserve public trust. Another could be moving towards the proportional system followed by Maine and Nebraska, rather than the \"winner take all\" system, to provide a more accurate representation of voters\\' will. This would also encourage more voter turnout and participation as their vote would actually count towards their chosen candidate.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe retaining and improving the Electoral College would be a more prudent course of preserving the balance of power and reinforcing the federative nature of our democracy. I hope that you, as a representative of our state, will voice and support these nuanced views regarding the Electoral College during legislative discussions.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration on this matter. \\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n(Your Name)Dear Florida State senator, I am in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states. Changing the election by popular vote is more efficient than the electoral college process. inputting this into the political voting system would enhance the voting process making it less difficult to deal with, get rid of the electoral college and its faults, and get the U.S citizens opinion on who the president should be and not just the electors voting for the president.\\n\\nAs you are already of aware of, the electoral college is the process where it consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and the Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. By the explanation of what the electoral college is, you and I and many others can conclude that this process takes too much workmuch more work than really does need to be put into place. Even though most Americans aren\\'t aware of that when they are electing for their choice of the president they compromise with the most, they are really voting for electors to vote who the next president will be. It\\'s not fair and it\\'s not right.\\n\\nWhile reading an article about the electoral collegeby Brad Plumer, I noticed that the electoral college system has numerous instances of it that make it wrong. While in place Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. chamber of commerce all agreed on abolishing the electoral college And I compromise with this agreement because it is completely accurate and make sense as to why these political figures wanted to rid of the electoral college. This is called a \"Disaster Factor\" according to paragraph 11 in the article \"The indefensible Electoral College\" meaning that the state legislatures are literally responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. How wrong is this? Also given that so many voter vote for one party for president and another for congress, the House of Representatives\\' selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.\\n\\nIn source 3 of the article, it was very precise on as to why the electoral college should no take place. Our country has both republicans and democrats. Not all democrats have the same opinions as republicans, and not all republicans have the same thoughts as democrats. According to paragraph 15, the Electoral college is widely regarded as anachronism, which is a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes is the winner. This is not fair to people who are democrats. The electoral system is obviously based off of mostly and strictly Republican beliefs. The voting process should be based on just republican bias, but also democrat bias. It\\'s as if the democrats thoughts mean nothing. Paragraph 19 made a claim that Republican bias is baed strictly off of the region in which on lives, because majority of Reoublicans live in the southern states of the U.S. This makes other peopleNo party, Democrats, etc. that are inhabited in othe regoins of the U.S. feel disenfranchised and feel as if their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their intrests, and that this person is not really their president.\\n\\nThe article gave me an outlook of what the electoral college really is and how it works. The electoral college is not a fair process at all, and it is way the complicated for the people involved in some political job that is involved with the president, it is hard on the citizens that live in this country that have an idea of what president they want to vote for, and it is hard on us as a nation. The election process should be changed by the process of popular vote of the country\\'s citizens. The electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. The electoral college needs to be abolished as soon as possible. Please take this into high consideration.Do you know why the earth has air pollution ? they are many reason from cars. Limiting car usage could have many advances because it can slow down air pollution,save money, and safety. Sit back and relax while I explain.\\n\\nTo begin one of the advantages of limiting car usage is that it can slow down air pollution.\\n\\nFirst reason that limiting car usage is that it can slow down air pollution is that because in the passage it says that \"after days of nearrecord pollution,Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" what that quote was basically saying was that the air pollution in paris was so terrible that they had to ban driving in order for the air to get stabilized. Next limiting car usage can slow down car pollution because it will keep major fuel companies from burning coal into the air. Lastly limiting car usage can slow down air pollution by using bikes,walking,taking the bus,riding skate boards,taking the subway,and ect.\\n\\nNext one of the advantages of limiting car usage is it saves money.\\n\\nthe first reason limiting car usage saves money is because in one of the passages it says that \"The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. violaters are to face 25 fines\". and I dont think any one want to be a part of that. Next one of the advantages of limiting car usage is that it saves money because when a person has a car they spend lots on money to put gas in their car every week and every year gas prices are rising. finally one of the advantages on limiting car usage is it saves money is because people that drive have to be aware of tickets that are very expensive also mantanace for your car like tires, lights,oil and ect if you limit your car usage over time you will see yourself spending less.\\n\\nFinally one advantage on limiting car usage is safety. The first reason lmiting car usage can raise safety is because in the passage it says \"pedestrian,bicycle,private cars,commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time,conserve resouses,lower emissions and improve safety\". The next reason limiting car usage can bring safety is by stoping traffic jams and droping the percentage of the amount of people dying fron car accidents. The final reason limiting car usage can bring safety keeping motorcyclists,bikers,and pedestrians from getting hit by cars also keeping drunk drivers of the streets.\\n\\nTo sum up they are many advantages of limiting car usage ,my reasons are it can slow down air pollution,save money, and safety I told you my reasons now tell me yours.Having a car can be very stressful and cost a lot of money. Not only does having a car hurt our earth but it hurts your wallet or you can hurt other people. Also you can get so much more exercise from just walking to where you need to go than taking your car. It seems difficulty to live without your car but they show that some people can do it , so can you.\\n\\nYou just moved into your new home in Vauban , Germany. You have to pay money just to park your car. In the article \"In german suburb, life goes on without cars.\" According to Elisabeth Rosenthal , it states in paragraph 2 that \"Car ownership is allowed , but there ar only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home.\" So if you want to park your car , you have to pay just to keep it there and always pay for your house.\\n\\nThink of all the people that have cars , take buses , basically anything with an engine is polluting our earth. In the article \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" according the writer , Robert Duffer it states in paragraph 10 that \"After days of nearrecord pollution , Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" They almost broke a record of so much pollution and the main reason of that is because of cars. So if you have less people driving them , the less polluted our world with be.\\n\\nInstead of driving just everywhere , you can get exricse and move your body to the place you need to go. Not only is it healthy for your body and life , its healthy for our world. In the article \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.\" The author Andrew Selsky stated in paragraph 20 that \"In a program thats set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.\" They got where the needed to go , without their car. So just on that one day , they helped out our world and themselves.\\n\\nIn conclusion , having no car is just better for everyone. You get to save so much money on gas or not having to pay for a parking spot. Our world is not as polluted with all thr smoke and gas that cars cause. You get to get exercise for the day and feel better. If you can go a day with no car , you can live your life with no car. So help save the world and your wallet by not using a car.Most people rely on vehicles for every day aarons. We use them to go to the store, beach, mall, everywhere, but don\\'t people think there may be consequences? Limiting this extensive car use can benefit everyone by allowing him or her to be happy and reduce pollution.\\n\\nTo begin, limiting reliance on vehicles may help people become happier. In Vaubun, Germany, many have sold their vehicles and are now walking or biking to their destinations. Some parents felt that when they had a car, \"they were always tense.\" 1 Instead of allowing themselves to be outside and free to move, they were trapped inside a small space. Now, they have the freedom to enjoy scenery, without a cost. In Bogota, Colombia, people hold an annual \"carfree day\". This event bans the use of any vehicle besides public buses and taxis. 3 \"The turnout was large, despite... the rain showers. The rain hasn\\'t stopped people from participating.\" 3 This shows that the citizens of Bogota are eager to attend such an event that prevents them of using their vehicles. Many believe this event is a \"good opportunity to take away stress\". 3 The event forces them to take a walk or get on their bike, without the stress of gas or tuneups. Young adults in the United States believe that getting a driver\\'s license is not a priority. They organize summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation.\" 4 This implies that they know walking is not as bad as it seems, and they do not need to rely on a car to get to places. Ultimately, this reduction of vehicle dependence can lead to less stress and a rise in happiness.\\n\\nfurthermore, reducing the usage of cars may help reduce pollution. In Paris, France, people have experienced \"nearrecord pollution. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air\".2 This experience included smog, a very dense layer of water and pollution particles. This air is very dangerous to breathe and live in. \"In this city, sixtyseven percent of vehicles use diesel.\" 2 Diesel is a heavier than gasoline, and is blamed for a large percentage of pollution. The ban alternates the usage of vehicles evennumbered plates go one day, oddnumbered the next. This process is sought to cut the usage and emission of pollutants in half. Walking, biking, using public transportation, etc. help reduce pollution because they are services given or provided to everyone. Walking and biking do not emit harmful pollutants. Buses allow people to commute along with other people, but stop anywhere you want. Using these services instead of selfowned vehicles will help reduce pollution.\\n\\nAll in all, cars are handy for going miles and miles on end, but restricting car use to go to the store or down the street can help people become happier and reduce pollution.Driving cars may seem like the best way to get from point A to point B, and in many ways, it is. Cars are fast, they are comfortable, and they can fit multiple people. The auto industry is big because of these factors. Though studies show that cars, may not be the best option for the environment and therefore, ourselves.\\n\\nThere is a city in Germany, Vauban. This city is almost completely devoid of cars. How do they do it? Well most of them ride bikes, or simply walk. If there is a distance to far for biking or walking, there is also a tram that runs through the city. The people who live in this city seem to be incredibly happy \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier now\" Source 1 says Heidrum Walter, citizen of Vauban. This trend of separation from automobiles is happening not only in europe, but everywhere in the world. The EPA is advocating \"car reduced communities\" in the United States. The world is changing \"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\" Source 1 The benefit of going carfree, goes beyond making people happier, it might even save the human race. Global warming is a major problem. Though an even bigger problem, is that most people in the US do not believe that global warming even exists. One way that scientists know that global warming is happening, is by looking in the ice of the artic. By drilling deep holes in the artic, scientists can extract tubes of ice millions of years old. Just how you can tell how old a tree is by counting its rings, you can tell how old ice is by doing the same thing. When scientists tested the amount of Co2 in a sample of ice that was formed 50 years after the industrial revolution, then compared it to the level of Co2 in a tube of ice 50 years before the industrial revolution. They saw a remarkable increase in Co2 levels after the industrial revolution. Many people do not know, but mercury looked a lot like earth a billion or so years ago. Now mercury is a desolated wasteland, thanks to the amount of volcanos spewing Co2 into the atmosphere. A similar phenomena is happening all over the world in places like Paris and China. Paris\\' pollution was so bad, that they had to ban driving for a couple days \"On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine\" Source 2 In Bagota, Columbia, people take part in a carfree day in order to reduce smog. \"Millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday\" Source 3 This is another example of people taking the initiative to give up cars, even if its only for one day.\\n\\nPeople are finally staring to realize that cars cause pollution to the Earth. Even the president is backing the cause, which honestly might be why more people have not accepted global warming as a fact. The level of driving has decreased over the years \"As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995\" Source 4 It is fantastic to know that people are finally embracing science as something to learn from, and not something to fear. What we all need to realize is that, our planet will live on millions of years after we are gone. We are not saving our planet by preventing global warming, we are saving ourselves.Dear State Senator, I believe that something should be brought to your attention. I\\'m concerned about the way we are handling the current election process of presidency. You see, at the moment weus Americansuse the Electoral College. But it is becoming a major issue. I understand that \"the founding fathers established it in the Constitution.\" But \"The Electoral College consists of 538 electors.\" Why focus all of our time choosing Electors, when we could be allowing citizens to vote directly for their President themselves. Office of the Federal Register states,\"The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors.\" Did you realize that \"a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President\"? We have millions of people in our country that could be doing the work themselves.\\n\\nI understand that life is not always fair, but I do believe that as a State Senator you could use a hand. \"The electors are generally chosen by the candidate\\'s political party.\" They could use a helping hand as well! \"The presidential election is held every four years.\" In those four years, American citizens wait eagerly and anxiously to choose a potential new president. Why don\\'t we give the people what they want? \"Most states have a winnertakesall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation.\\'\" These complications could be avoided if we listened to what the citizens have to say and allowed them the freedom to vote for their president directly. America is the land of freedom after all, is it not Senator?\\n\\n\"According to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" A recent article by Bradford Plumer says,\"It\\'s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.Dear senator, I believe the Electoral College System is wrong.\\n\\nIn source number 2, Bradford Plumer states, \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\". In other words, your vote is basically in the hands of someone else, and hopefully they vote for who you want what\\'s even worse is electors are picked on at state conventions, sometimes state party\\'s central committee, or even sometimes the presidential candidates, so you, the citizens don\\'t get to pick the elector. Voters can not always control who their electors vote for and voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.\\n\\nMoreover, in source number 2, Bradford Plumer states, \"The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor... state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people...electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.\". Furthermore, this shows how the citizens of the United States of America really don\\'t have a direct, liberal,voting system to choose who they want to won the election because at anypoint the electors can just go against what the citizens want and vote for who they please.\\n\\nLastly, Plumer states, \"the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each states, candidates don\\'t spend time in each state because they know they hvae no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \\'swing\\' states.\". Basically,this is saying that small states don\\'t get to see campaigns or any of that because they\\'re small states so they don\\'t evem get a visit from the elector.\\n\\nOverall, The electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. We should all have the right to vote for who we want directly and not have to go through electors which there is a very high chance they might change their minds and vote for the other party.State Senator, If the slogan of our nation is \"We the people,\" why do we the people not actually get to vote for the president? How can a president win the popular vote but lose the presidency? None of that makes any sense. Our nation needs to abolish the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The system of the Electoral College is irrational, unfair, and not for the citizens.\\n\\nTo begin, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. \"Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.\" Plumer, paragraph 13. \"Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" Plumer, paragraph 11. If the United States is really all about the citizens, then they do not have a good way at showing it. We as citizens live here, and call this nation our home, but yet we can not even elect our own president. The Electoral College is unfair to us as voters.\\n\\nIn addition, \"The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you\\'re actually voting for a state of electors.\" Posner, paragraph 15. That textual evidence came from a passage in defense of the Electoral College! We the people should have a say! This system is not for us as citizens of the United States, and it is wrong! This is our home so let US pick our president.\\n\\nFurthermore, \"... and the most thoughful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\" Posner, paragraph 20. This statement is very true because voters should be thorough when voting, but why should we be? It is not like we need to take our time and compare and contrast the presidential candidates. We are not voting for the president of our choice, so what is the point of being thorough? It is wrong to have this system, and it needs to be changed.\\n\\nTo conclude, as I have said above, If the slogan of our nation is \"We the people,\" why do we the people not actually get to vote for the president? The system of the Electoral College needs to be abolished. It is not letting us as citizens elect our choice of the president that we want. It is unfair and irrational. I am in favor of changing the system to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the reliance on cars, communities can improve air quality, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. This can be seen in examples from around the world, such as Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, and Bogota, Colombia.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Greenhouse gas emissions from cars are a major contributor to global warming. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. In the United States, car-intensive areas can contribute up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing car usage, communities can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and help combat climate change.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. In her article \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" Robert Duffer explains how a partial driving ban in Paris resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and significantly reduced smog levels. Similarly, Andrew Selsky discusses the popularity of car-free days in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work, leading to clear streets and reduced traffic jams. These examples demonstrate how limiting car usage can lead to cleaner air and a healthier environment for all.\\n\\nMoreover, limiting car usage can promote a more active and healthier lifestyle. In Elisabeth Rosenthal\\'s article \"The End of Car Culture,\" she highlights the decrease in car ownership, fewer miles driven, and a decline in the number of licenses being acquired in the United States. This shift in behavior suggests a cultural shift towards alternative modes of transportation. The presence of more bike paths, pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and improved public transport options can encourage people to walk, bike, or use public transport more frequently, resulting in increased physical activity and improved overall health.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing reliance on cars, communities can improve air quality, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. Examples from around the world, such as Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage. It is clear that embracing alternative modes of transportation is not only beneficial for the planet but also for our own well-being.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[State Senator\\'s Name]\\n[State Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nDear [State Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering both sides of the argument, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote. This view is supported by the information provided in the texts \"What Is the Electoral College?\", \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\", and \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President.\"\\n\\nThe Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of the President by Congress and election by a popular vote of citizens, as explained in the text \"What Is the Electoral College?\" This system consists of the selection of electors who vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Each state is allocated a number of electors equal to its Congressional delegation, creating a representation based on both population and statehood.\\n\\nOne strong argument in favor of the Electoral College, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner in \"In Defense of the Electoral College,\" is the certainty of outcome. The winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote, ensuring that a clear winner is determined. This is not often the case in elections based purely on a popular vote, where disputes over the outcome and potential run-off elections can arise. The Electoral College provides a more certain and efficient method of selecting the President.\\n\\nAnother important aspect of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as mentioned by Judge Posner. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own, so candidates must campaign across different states and regions in order to secure the necessary electoral votes. This ensures that presidents represent the entire nation and not just one particular region, promoting national unity and better governance.\\n\\nThe text \"In Defense of the Electoral College\" also explains that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This allows for more focused and meaningful engagement with voters in these states, who become the main decision-makers in the election. The Electoral College system ensures that voters in these states have a greater say in the outcome, while also maintaining a balance of attention towards both big and small states.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the electoral process. As mentioned by Judge Posner, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner by requiring a majority of electoral votes, even if a candidate has only a plurality of the popular vote. This avoids the need for additional rounds of voting and maintains the efficiency of the election process.\\n\\nWhile there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as those presented in \"The Indefensible Electoral College,\" I believe that the benefits of this system outweigh the disadvantages. It ensures certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses on swing states, provides balance between big and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These practical reasons, as highlighted by Judge Posner, demonstrate the value of the Electoral College in our democratic system.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I urge you to consider the importance and merits of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. It strikes a balance between the popular vote and representation, promoting fairness, national unity, and efficient governance. I believe that keeping the Electoral College is crucial for maintaining a stable and effective method of electing the President.\\n\\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the arguments presented and make a decision that upholds the best interests of our state and nation.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]dear senator, I have come to a conclusion on how I think the president and his candidates should be voted for. In one hand we\\'ve got the Electoral College, and the election by popular vote. These two thing have been around for hundreds of years but you\\'ve got to know if you prefer one or the other. So which one works better? Why do you prefer this one over the other?\\n\\nThe Electoral College, electors meeting and voting for our president and vice president. This electoral college consist of 538 electors that vote to for our president. I myself dont think this is a very sensible thing. Because when you think you\\'re voting for the president you are actually voting for a state of electors who will in turn vote for the president not you. Why should there be a select few people out of the billions of people who live in america to vote for the president while we just sit and wait for the results. To only have their opinions voiced. Does\\'nt seem like a very fair way to elect someone who will be changing our country. This is a winnertakeallsystem.\\n\\nElection by popular vote, this means you and I will be voting for the president and his cabinet ourselves. That we will have a say in who we want to change or even fix our country. Although the person we vote for may not win, we still got a say in what we believe would have made our country a better place. Although the Electoral College might give a more clear winner, if we know that our vote will actually have an effect in the election we might pay more attention to the election and vote more wisely. Knowing that we have voiced our preference rather than knowing maybe one single electoral vote might have set the election.\\n\\nNow there are some benefits if the Electoral College. In the case of having a precise vote on who gets to be president is one. Also maybe the fact that you voted fo the people who will be electing the president in a way is just the same. However this does notmean that it is better than you just voting yourself. Because those are onlyabout the two thing that are evn remotely good about the Electoral College.\\n\\nSo when you decide who you want to be president think of how you would like your vote to be heard. through your own vote or maybepossibly through anothers vote. I know which system i would choose. Giving that it would give me more voicein the matter.Dear Mr. Senator, The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation\\'s new president. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electorss, the meeting of the electorss where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electorsal votes by Congress,\" states the article \"What Is the Electoral College?\" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electorss that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation. Our presidential campaign will be much better if we change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.\\n\\nTo begin with, the Electoral College is the cause for many issues in our nation\\'s presidential campaign. First of all, voters sometimes cannot even control whom their electorss vote for. Ergo, one may vote for an electors of our favorite candidate\\'s party, however, we don\\'t know if that electors will go back on his word and vote for another candidate. The article \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer states, \"The single best argument against the electorsal college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electorss, and that those electorss could always defy the will of the people\". This means that the people never know if their electorss are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate. Aside from that, their is the worrying aspect of a tie occurring. If that were to happen, then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. The article The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer states, \"In 1968, a shift of just 41, 971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii had voted the other way\". This says that if those people had just voted for the opposite person, then there would have been a tie between the two candidates. Yes, those numbers seem large, but in comparison to the number of voters that there were in those years, they\\'re a small fraction of them. This shows how close elections are with the Electoral College.\\n\\nAside from causing issues in the United States, the Electoral College is extremely unfair to voters. The article, \"What Is the Electoral College?\" written by the Office of the Federal Register states, \"Most states have a winnertakeall\\' system that awards all electorss to the winning presidential candidate\". That is not fair to other voters who don\\'t vote for the popular candidate in their state they don\\'t receive any electorss. Additionally, most candidates only advertise and visit \"swing\" states. \"Swing\" states are the states that usually determine the outcome of the election. \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer says, \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn\\'t get to see a single campaign ad\". It\\'s unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electorss in your state, you don\\'t get to watch your candidates campaign. As previously mentioned, each state has a different number of electorsal votes. It all depends on the population. For example, Texas, with a huge population has 38 electorss, while Maine only has 4. The article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid out defenses of the system are wrong\" states, \"Beacuse each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters\". Why do some states have more representatives than others just because of their population? It\\'s not fair to the smaller states. It is true that the bigger states have more people in them, needing more representation, however, the smaller states have as much to say as the big ones. \\' To conclude, the Electoral College has caused many disastrous factors in our presidential campaigns. It has caused the wrong president to be elected, and it doesn\\'t give our citizens much of a voice in the election. However, changing the system to popular vote for the president will give people a louder voice in this nation and it will show them that the government cares about their opinion. As the article, \"The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid out defenses are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer states, \"It\\'s officual: The Electoral College is unfaor, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguents against direct elections are spurious at best.To the State Senate, Addressing my ultimate opinion, I believe should change the vote of the Electoral College into a popularbased vote. Examining a large number of articles which has fulfilled my understanding of the Electoral College including the process and diverse opinions of the Electoral College. This essay will propose the counterclaim the opposing side of why we should not change the process of vote in the United States and address the counterclaim of why the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. In order to understand each side, we must first comprehend the process behind the Electoral College. Posner stated, \"...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you\\'re actually voting for a slate of electors\" 3. This is the one of the most important concepts to understand in the process of the Electoral College, for we must know that each vote you compose, you vote for a slate of electors, who will basically vote for their candidate. \"The Electoral College is a process, not a place\" Office of the Federal Register, 1. This lets us put down a foundation of the Electoral College as well.\\n\\nAccording to Plumer, \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote\" 2. This indicates how the tie could carry the vote to the House of Representatives, where the federal judgement takes place of voting for the president. Not only this, but Plumer also stated,\"Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters\" 2. This statement from Plumer strongly imposes the knowledge that this tie carried to the House of Representatives would hardly reflect the will of the people due to census of the population. This article highlighted that the vote in 2000 where the system actually seemed to flaw when Gore recieved a higher popular vote than Bush, however, Bush received a higher electoral vote. In this situation, is this truly fair? This example dipicts how the vote is truly determined on a group of people from the population rather than a vote depending upon the entire nation itself. Plumer stated, \"...the electoral college is unfair to voters...swing states...\" 2. This brings us the idea of the swing states and how the candidates in the winnertakeall system do not bother to go to states they know that they have no chance of winning, which harshly reveals that some votes may be biased from the electors ignoring other states. \"It\\'s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" Plumer,2. This concludes how biased the Electoral College can be when it comes to ties, representatives, the disaster factor, and a great multitude of concepts and situations where the Electoral College has flawed.\\n\\nNow, I have also read articles that contained letters that emphasized why the Electoral College should not be changed in any way, due to the \"...Certainty of Outcome...Everyone\\'s President...Swing States...Big States... Avoid RunOff Elections...\" Posner, 3. These subtitles are points that Posner focused on that he believes can persuade why the Electoral College is somewhat efficient. In each of these points, I can counter that the certainty of the vote is false due to the fiasco of Gore and Bush in 2000, as well as the concept of the House of Representatives that I mentioned earlier as well. In the factor that Posner mentioned in his point of everyone\\'s president, I do not find this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumer that a winnertakesall method is unfair to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Posner pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,\"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution...\" 3. In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of representatives due to population, which is not the voter\\'s decision. In the statement of Avoid Runoff Elections, Posner states that, \"The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast\" 3. I find this false due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because there is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swingstates are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America.[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[State Senator\\'s Name]\\n[State Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nDear [State Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my perspective on the debate regarding the Electoral College and the system by which we elect the President of the United States. After careful consideration and examining various arguments from multiple sources, I am convinced that the Electoral College should be maintained for the following reasons:\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register\\'s publication on the Electoral College, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is lessened in comparison to a dispute over the popular vote. The winner-take-all basis of electoral votes awarded by most states ensures that even the slightest plurality creates a landslide victory for a candidate in that particular state.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. By requiring a presidential candidate to gain support across different regions, the Electoral College ensures that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. As Judge Richard A. Posner contends, this is a desirable result as it prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being successful. This system ensures that the president elected has the interests of all regions in mind, making them \"everyone\\'s president.\"\\n\\nThirdly, the Electoral College promotes the importance of swing states. By focusing campaign efforts on toss-up states, candidates are encouraged to engage more with voters in these states. As seen in the 2012 election, swing states attract more attention from the candidates, leading to a higher level of engagement and thoughtful voting. In a system based solely on the popular vote, candidates may neglect areas where their victory or loss is already predetermined, resulting in fewer engaged voters overall.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College balances the weight of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as established in the Constitution, grants large states fewer electoral votes on a per capita basis. However, as Judge Posner points out, a large state like Florida, despite having a close popular vote in 2012, was able to secure 29 electoral votes. This allocation of electoral votes ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns and needs of more populous states, providing fair representation to citizens across the country.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. Instead of requiring a majority vote, the Electoral College produces a clear winner. Run-off elections can be complicated and time-consuming, as seen in cases like Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, who won a majority in the Electoral College despite only having a plurality of the popular votes. By avoiding run-off elections, the Electoral College streamlines the process and ensures a clear and decisive outcome.\\n\\nWhile critics of the Electoral College argue that it can lead to less voter engagement in non-competitive states, the high voter turnout in the 2012 election reveals that voters are motivated by the desire to express a political preference rather than the expectation that their vote will decide the election. Additionally, the Electoral College serves to protect against the disaster factor, highlighted by Bradford Plumer, where state legislatures and \"faithless\" electors could disrupt the democratic process.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College, with its practical reasons for existence, provides a fair and balanced method of electing the President of the United States. It ensures certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, promotes engagement in swing states, balances the weight of large and small states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. These advantages outweigh the criticisms and calls for its abolition. Therefore, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College system.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]It\\'s the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, can you guess what it is? It\\'s election day! Every four years, nearly every person in America will vote to choose a new President, or do we? Yes, we live in a democracy where we can vote for who runs out country, but do we really make the decision? The Electoral College is a phase where electors, of a candidate running for president, come together and decide for who is the President, Vice President, and include the counting of the electoral votes from Congress. The person who runs for President has a select group of people known as electors, which are typically chosen by that person\\'s political party. Is this who we really vote for, and is it fair? This should be eradicated.\\n\\nBy using the Electoral College, we don\\'t directly vote for our own President. We vote for fisher\\'s electors. It\\'s them who really choose who leads us, not us! In \"What Is the Electoral College?\" it states that \"...when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate\\'s electors,\" meaning we aren\\'t actually voting for a President, just fisher\\'s electors. It could literally be anybody, not holding public office. This is not a direct way for us to vote for who makes the decisions around here. In \"Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,\" it claims that \"...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" Sixty percent said that! That\\'s incredible.\\n\\nThe electoral votes are just unequal. The states that are bigger would obviously get more electoral votes than, let\\'s say Maryland. California would have more votes than Maryland because it i smuch bigger. The House of Represenatives has its own unique way of handling that, and they\\'re going just fine, we don\\'t need another. It just isn\\'t reliable, the numbers and percentages would be all boggled up. This country is based on equality and liberty. and there is no equality in this.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is much too confusing. Sometimes voters could be discombabulated about who it is they are voting for. Sometimes voters can\\'t control who the electors vote for. This is both confusing and frustrating for anyone who thinks they voted for someone great, but the electors change that. In \"Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,\" it says that \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\", meaning that we don\\'t choose for ourselves, they do.\\n\\nSome could say \"its anarchy\", or that \"its not democratic\", which could be true. In \"In defense of the Electoral College...,\" it states that \"But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee...however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.\" This means that even though you vote for a person, it\\'s probably a fiftyfifty chance your person will win. It does also help release the stress of worrying about a runoff election, and avoids the problem where no candidate receives a majority of votes that has been cast.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is not the best way to vote in our beautiful country. It can be decieving and confusing. Though it may have one or two advantages, the list of things that can go wrong with it are of plenty. It is unfair, and could turn nasty. It should be abolished. Make America more equal.Limiting car usage comes with benefits for everything. It benefits the environment, yourself, and everyone else in the world.\\n\\nIf you use your car less or just use it when you need it, the amount of pollutants in the air from vehicle transportation would drop drastically. Vehicles are the second leading cause of pollution in the world behind factories. Cars are responsible for up to fifty percent of gas emissions in heavy traffic areas in the United States according to Elisabeth Rosenthal\\'s essay \"In German suburb, life goes on without cars\". It is a very simple concept, cars produce gas emission, and using your car less can help protect the environment from pollutants.\\n\\nThe environment is not the only thing benefitted from limited car usage. You become healthier if you choose to totally lose the vehicle. Heidrun Walter stated \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" Limiting car usage can also limit stress in a person. Besides being stress free, if you choose to walk to where you need to go, you exercise and do not realize it. Basically, if you want to lower your stress, not be tense, or be healthier, just limit your car usage and walk or ride a bicycle.\\n\\nVehicle accidents are a major cause of death in the world. So, if you decide to not use your car as much and just walk or bike, that is one less driver on the road. If the trend of limiting car usage and walking or biking spreads, the threats on the roadways will lower drastically. So in turn, using your car less can help keep everyone safe and help lower the amount of vehicle accidents and save lives.\\n\\nWith more people on the side walks, and less people behind the wheel, everyone can be benefitted. From stress to gas emission, everything can be solved with limiting your car usage.Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: A Gateway to Improved Urban Life and Environment \\n\\nThe world is currently grappling with various complications related to over-reliance on cars such as congestion, pollution, and adverse effects on general lifestyle. As the auto-dependent culture continues to dominate, urban centers across the globe are setting precedent for the benefits of smarter planning and reduced auto usage. \\n\\nA foremost case example is Vauban, an upscale German suburb, which successfully adopted a suburban lifestyle free of cars. Making most streets car-free have led to surprisingly positive results, with 70% families choosing not to own cars (Rosenthal, par. 3). Vauban\\'s system has significantly limited cars to a few thoroughfares and strategically positioned parking garages. This system not only is creating a serene and greener suburb but also curtails toxic emission levels, serving as an elucidating model of \\'smart planning\\' (Rosenthal, par. 4).\\n\\nThe detrimental impacts of over-dependence on cars manifest considerably in cities like Paris and Bogota. Paris experienced a noticeable and alarming increase in smog, traced mainly to diesel fuel emissions (Duffer, par. 14-16). France\\'s partial ban on driving remarkably reduced congestion by 60%, implying how limiting car usage can instantly improve air quality (Duffer, par. 14). In Bogota, the \"car-free day\" initiative serves as an annual reminder of the significant positive transformations that can occur when cities reduce car usage, including less traffic and pollution (Selsky, par. 21).\\n\\nCar culture, commonly associated with the United States, is witnessing an interesting shift. Recent studies highlight that Americans are driving less and getting fewer licenses (Rosenthal, par. 29). This change is opined to be a fundamental cultural shift catalyzed not just by economic reasons but various factors including the appeal of city centers, the practicalities of telecommuting, and efficient public transport (Rosenthal, par. 33-35).\\n\\nLimiting car usage offers tremendous environmental advantages. For instance, passenger cars contribute to 12% of Europe\\'s greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, par. 5). With transportation being the second largest source of America’s emissions, reducing car usage significantly helps in curbing this scenario (Rosenthal, par. 34).\\n\\nThis cultural shift is bound to have its ripples and upheavals, especially in the automobile industry, which has to quickly adapt to these evolving trends or face obsolescence. Companies like Ford and Mercedes have already begun rebranding themselves as \"mobility\" companies, indicating the larger transition in perceptive towards car usage (Rosenthal, par. 34). Such shifts demand strategic partnerships with other sectors to create an all-encompassing network incorporating pedestrians, bicycles, and public transportation (Rosenthal, par. 43).\\n\\nGoing forward, the lingering question is whether focusing on these evolving trends will be a powerful enough motivator to encourage more locations to follow suit. However, the examples outlined provide a clear and irrefutory precedent of the potential benefits of limited car use, positioning it as a key strategy toward smarter and sustainable urban planning. Ultimately, such measures can contribute towards an environmentally friendly society, less stressful lifestyles, and healthier citizens.Title: The Winning Race Towards Limiting Car Usage: A Green Revolution \\n\\nThe concept of reducing car usage in society is progressively becoming not just a necessity, but a significant trend. Post-industrial societies are increasingly recognizing the myriad benefits that come with this shift. In this discussion, we will overview the advantages of limiting car usage, as observed in several global instances.\\n\\nVauban, a suburb in Germany, is one pioneer community that has adopted a largely car-free lifestyle (Rosenthal, Passage 1). In fact, 70 percent of Vauban\\'s families do not own cars (Rosenthal, Passage 1). The outcome is a high-quality life free of the usual urban tensions, significantly reduced emissions, and a quieter, safer environment with thriving flora and fauna (Rosenthal, Passage 1). Not to mention, the replacement of car spaces with large green spaces and public parks, significantly enhancing the community\\'s aesthetics.\\n\\nA contrasting example showcasing the advantages of limiting car usage is portrayed by the city of Paris. The city, known for its high pollution levels, once imposed a partial driving ban that resulted in a dramatic 60 percent decrease in congestion within just five days (Duffer, Passage 2). As a result, the smog levels fell significantly. This instance proposes an interface between reduced car usage and the overall improvement of air quality, especially in dense urban areas.\\n\\nThe \\'Day Without Cars\\' initiative in Bogota, Colombia, presents an impactful showcase of reducing car usage leading to the enhancement of public health and quality of life. During this day, the goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog (Selsky, Passage 3). This event led to Bogota becoming a city with the highest number, 118 miles, of bicycle paths in the whole Latin American region (Selsky, Passage 3). The significant physical activity and reduced pollution demonstrate dual health benefits- physical well-being and air unpolluted by harmful exhaust gases. \\n\\nLastly, the shift from car culture is also identified in the United States. Recent studies reveal that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less (Rosenthal, Passage 4). One outcome is the beneficial impact on carbon emissions and the environment, which is a positive move towards mitigating climate change (Rosenthal, Passage 4). \\n\\nIn conclusion, communities worldwide are demonstrating numerous advantages by limiting car usage: improved air quality, safer and quieter neighborhoods, and promotion of healthy lifestyles. Additionally, the move allows for the creation and enhancement of green spaces and public areas. Societal shift away from private car ownership also represents a significant stride towards achieving sustainable development goals and addressing the global climate change crisis.Limiting the usage of cars has personal and professional support all across the globe and yet it has yet to be embraced everywhere. Statistical proof show where it may help and real life examples of some of the effects of reducing, or getting rid of altogether, cars in one\\'s daily life. While \"recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by\" Source 4, is that really enough or for the right reason? There are plenty of reasons to stop, or limit, the amount of cars being driven on the roads for every kind of person, from the hippie to the businessman, from the mom to the college student. With so many things in this world that few people agree on, this is a nice change to see in regards the removal of so many cars. Why would they all agree, one might ask. Well, there are plenty of reasons.\\n\\nFor starters, stress. It is no secret that morning traffic jams and o\\'clock traffic is often enough to send any driver into a fit of unadulterated rage and what better way is there to prevent that than to simply not drive at all? Mother and media trainer, Heidrum Walter attested to this after moving into a mostly carless community, claiming \"when she had a car she was always tense. She\\'s much happier that way\" Source 1. If that were not enough, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza who participated in the Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia, after just a day was able to say \"it\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress\" Source 3. Just one day was enough to destress this man and if that does not speak wonders, one has to wonder what does. The event \"left the streets of Bogota eerily devoid of traffic jams\" Source 3, which goes to show how stressful it was everyday, with traffic jams a common occurance. No one enjoys them, so why continue to suffer through them?\\n\\nAdditionally, the environment suffers greatly from the many car emissions let out on the roads. \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States\" Source 1. This alone should be enough to horrify anyone out of such copious amounts of car usage. If that were not enough, \"transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions\" Source 4. It is clear that cars are only doing more harm to this earth all humans live on and happen to only have one of, so there is no need to continue on knowing this without changing something about that. Even carpooling could significantly reduce emissions as there would be less cars out there, which is possible through \"more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work\" Source 4.\\n\\nOf course, adding the last two reasons together makes for another very important factor in all of this: everyone\\'s general health. Both stress and high concentrations of smog can do a toll on one\\'s body and the reduction of cars, once again, helps to reduce this terrible downsides to the easy transportation option. If it must be described as \"emissions... are choking cities\" Source 1, then why not be a bit more concerned. Air pollution can affect those with preexisting respitory issues and stress can be a deciding factor in how effient and well a person can function. Stress on the road can lead to unsafe driving and a worse performance at work, school, or any other taskoriented location that many go to with the aid of a car.\\n\\nIt is also worth noting that cities that have embraced a no car lifestyle such as Vauban or Bogota have generally improved as a community and have given back anything the newly carless citizens may have been missing out on through saving them time and money. In Vauban, \"stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway\" Source 1. This is not only much more costefficient, but also convienent. This is saving both time and money, just like in Bogota where \"parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\" Source 3. Not only does this help individual citizens and business owners, it helps the overall economy of the city as well.\\n\\nIndividual car use isn\\'t bad. Millions of individuals using cars, however, is very bad. Note the emphasis. Even just making a concious effort to car pool, bike to work or school, use public transportation, or use some sort of alternative transportation could be enough to clear up the air of some of it\\'s emissions, keep oneself and others happier and less stressed, save time and money, and improve their city all in one little decision. It\\'s just a matter of going ahead and doing it, so what is stopping anyone from going out and making that change now? Be the change you want to see and limit your car usage now.\"It\\'s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" Plumer, Source 2. Many do not like the electoral college for these reasons and many others such as it can be a disaster or because it is just plain dumb. Also there are a few reasons why the electoral college should be kept such as avoiding runoff elections or big states, but those not in favor of it out weigh those in favor of it. The people who despise the electoral college are in favor of popular vote since it is the better choice.\\n\\nFor various reasons the electoral college is unfair such as not everyones decisions count just those few people in the electoral college. In a popular vote election everyones vote counts not just those who are considered better than us because they hold authority over people. Those people can also be sneaky and can change votes to be in favor of their choice of president. They will even take bribes sometimes just because they can even though us other people do count.\\n\\nThe system should not even be here today because it is outdated way past our time. \"It\\'s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolsi the electoral college!\" Plumer, Source 2 and many others do agree with this statement because it rather true that we do so instead of let a bunch of monkeys run our states and country, but I am pretty sure that sometimes they could even do a better job than those in office right now. \".....over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now\" Plumer, Source 2 every day as we continue that percentage continues to grow and that data was recorded in 2000.\\n\\nLastly, the electoral college is irrational like seriously what idiotic person came up with this. I will say this again, but a monkey could of made a better system than this. \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president........Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party\\'s central committee, soemtimes the presidential candidate themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. DO voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candiate? Sometimes\" Plumer, Source 2 I know this statement says it all because how could one simply not want popular vote after reading this.\\n\\nI know that electoral college vote can help and not cause problems, but there are more problems while there is one easy fix which is popular vote. \"It\\'s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" Plumer, Source 2.Dear Senator of Florida, I believe the electoral college should be abolished as a process over all. The electoral college should be abolished because it does not benefit the U.S. in anyway and has caused multiple problems in elections over the past years. The electoral college should not be a part of the U.S. Constitution and it only causes issues while elections are present therefore we as a country should elect by popular vote.\\n\\nThe electoral college should be abloshied because it has caused multiple problems over the past years during elections and could continue to cause problems. The electoral college process consists of selecting electors, as you know, but those electors do not always vote for their parties candidates like they should. This process causes the popular vote to not always guarantee presidency to a certain candidate even if they have the popular vote. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote but lost presidency because of the electoral college. Not only did one incident occur but multiple occur because of the electoral college. As stated in paragraph 11 of Bradford plumber\\'s article, in 1960 segregationists in louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy so if Kennedy got the popular vote he wouldnt have got the presidency. Like Bradford Plumer clearly stated \"the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational.\" The electoral college should be abolished so that problems can be eliminated and elections are fair.\\n\\nThe electoral college should not only be abolished, or destroyed, because it causes problems but also because it does not benefit the United States in any way. The outdated, unfair system just hurts the U.S. government and the country as a whole, it does not benefit our government or citizens in anyway what so ever. Under the electoral college system voters are voting for a slate of electors who don\\'t always vote for their own party candidate rather than voting for the candidate they want to govern our country. 60% of voters would prefer direct election and popular vote anyway so why not throw out the old worn down process that docent work and replace it with something the people of this country actually want, popular vote. Some people might say we should keep the electoral college because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee so nothing can happen but according to history things can happen such as in the 2000 election. Why keep a process that the majority of the citizens of this country don\\'t want and a process that just causes issues.\\n\\nThe electoral college is a thing of the past, a has been that almost no one wants around. Popular vote elections would be more fair and will not have mistakes during elections like the huge mistakes the electoral college system has proven to display. The citizens of America want the electoral college gone and popular vote elections should be what the government is aiming for so we do not have mistakes in our elections and so the U.S. can benefit from actually having a working election process.A Electoral College is a meeting of thee electors where theey vote for president and vice president. \"The founding fatheers established it in thee constitution as a compromise between election of thee president by a vote in Congress and election of thee President by a vote in Congress and thee election of thee President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\" We should keep thee Electoral College because of thee certainty of outcome, theat everyones president and thee swing states. These are some reasons on to keep our despised metheod of thee choosing thee president.\\n\\nWe should keep thee Electoral College because of thee certainty of outcome. The certainty of outcome is a dispute over thee outcome of an Electoral College. According to thee passage \" thee reason is theat thee winning candidates share of thee Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of thee popluar vote.\" For examples, President Obama recieved about 62% of thee electoral vote when rodney had about 52% popular votes casted to him. Even a tie is possible because theeres a total of 538 number of votes and its an even number.\\n\\nSecondly,everyone is president. None if thee regions has enough votes to elect a president so no favorite has power to campaign heavily. So if thee favorite was rodney he will not gain any vote by by increasing his plurality in states theat he knows theat he will win. According to source theree.\"thee residents of thee otheer regions are likely to feel disenfranchisedto feel theat theeir votes do not count,theat thee new president will have no regard for theeir interests,theat he really isn\\'t theeir president.\"Line 19 This means theat thee people who vote will theink theat its a waste of theeir time since theeir vote will not count. They will be ignored knowing theat theeir vote will have no interest and theat thee president wont really be theier president.\\n\\nThirdly, we should keep it because of thee swing states. The swing states is a winnertakeall metheod. Voters will pay more attention to thee campaign because theey know theat theey will decide on thee election. They will be known as thee theoughtful voters because theey will have recieved thee most information and attention and should be thee ones the decide thee election. The otheer people wont know alot about thee candiadates and will just pick theeir favorite.\\n\\nSome people might argue about thee disator factor. Its where theere is a tie between thee states. They might say what will happen theen? However, theats why theere is representatives. They break thee tie on who to become president.\\n\\nIn conclusion,we should keep thee Electoral college because of thee certainty of outcome, everyones president and by thee swing states.The Electoral College gives certain states, based on their popularity, a number of how many of what I guess can be called \"points\" that will go to to the candidate that gets the most votes for themself out of that state. Now whether that is a good idea or not is completely based on your own opion which you can decide. But I disagree with the Electoral College, even though it did take me a while of thinking I came to the conclusion that an all out popular vote is more efficient when it comes to voting for a president than the electoral college, and there is three main reasons that swung me to side with popular vote, First of all, when you get right down to it the Electoral College just doesnt give perfect accuracy on who does actually get the exact most votes. Some people cant completely grasp this fact but imagine that there is Florida, Alaska, and Montana. The first candidate, which we shall call John and the second, Bill, are going for these three states. John beats Bill on Florida 5,000 to 4,999 and John gets all 29 electoral votes because of that, tough luck for Bill. Luckily for Bill he sweeps over John in Alaska 100 to 0 and montana 100 0 and gets 3 points from each state which gives him 6 points total. So now by popular vote Bill would win with 5,199 votes against John\\'s 5,000. But since Bill only has 6 Electoral points because he still lost Florida, which was the state John won and got a whopping 29 points from, Bill will lose his campaign to John 296 because thats what the amazing \"wonders\" of the Electoral College are. Which basically sums up how in 2000 Al Gore lost to Bill Gates even that Al Gore had more overall votes.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also makes candidates have to strategically plan out their campaign so they can focus on big states and swing states only. If a candidate knows he will not win a certain state he wont even focus on it because it would be pointless, even if he changes maybe a couple thousand voters\\' minds, it wont get him a single point if he loses that state 5000 15000 whereas with popular vote changing the mind of people so that you get yourself from having 10% of California\\'s overall votes for you to 30% means more votes than literally all of alaskans eligible voting population. So that drives candidates away from states they wont win and they go to states known as \"swing states\" that dont have a specific party that they vote for every election, and they will attempt to win these states votes the most because those points will make the biggest difference.\\n\\nThe final thing I\\'d like to touch on is that the Electoral College system takes so many peoples idea and erases it. We want our vote to mean something throughout the whole campaign, but it doesnt matter if you are one the few democrat supporters in an overall republican dominated state because when your state loses 5000 to 150, poof! There goes your vote floating off into oblivion because it doesnt matter now, your one vote doesnt stand a chance against 50 going against it according to the Electoral College. We want our vote to count for the candidate himself not be part of some majorly flawed point system that someone thought would help somehow when picking the right candidate to become the head honcho sitting in charge of The White House, Our Country, and be the overall leader of our military forces too. So we need our vote to be heard and for it to actually count, even if 5000 more people disagree with 2500 in the same state, those 2500 votes should actually count towards something instead of being overrun and erased by the 5000 which will earn some candidate a couple of points for their campaign.\\n\\nNow after all this not only has my own opinion strongly changed in favor of popular vote but I hope yours has too. Electoral College just doesnt provide that actual perfect accuracy of who wins that popular does, it forces presidents to only visit and campaign in certain states that they have a chance of winning, and it takes citizens votes and throws them down the drain if more people in the same state vote differently. It just makes you sit and wonder whos idea it was to accept this system.'"
